<h3>THE YOUNG AND THE OLD.</h3>


<p>"I like your Roland," said Miss Vernon. She
had come to pay one of her usual visits to her old
relations. The grandson whom Hester had made
acquaintance with without seeing his face, had now
been nearly a week at the Vernonry and was known
to everybody about. The captain's precautions had,
of course, come to nothing. He had gone, as in duty
bound, to pay his respects to the great lady who
was his relation too, though in a far-off degree, and
he had pleased her. Catherine thought of nothing
less than of giving a great pleasure to her old friends
by her praise. "He is full of news and information,
which is a godsend to us country folks, and he is
very good-looking, <i>qui ne g&acirc;te rien</i>."</p>

<p>Mrs. Morgan looked up from her place by the
fireside with a smile of pleasure. She sat folding her
peaceful old hands with an air of beatitude, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
notwithstanding her content, had not been upon
her countenance before the young man's arrival.</p>

<p>"That is a great pleasure to me, Catherine&mdash;to
know that you like him," said the old lady. "He
seems to me all that, and kind besides."</p>

<p>"What I should have expected your grandson to
be," said Catherine. "I want him to see the people
here, and make a few acquaintances. I don't suppose
that our little people at Redborough can be of much
importance to a young man in town; still it is a pity
to neglect an opportunity. He is coming to dine
with me to-morrow&mdash;as I suppose he told you?"</p>

<p>The old lady nodded her head several times with
the same soft smile of happiness.</p>

<p>"You are always good," she said; "you have done
everything, Catherine, for me and my old man. But
if you want to go straight to my heart you know the
way lies through the children&mdash;my poor Katie's boys."</p>

<p>"I am glad that the direct route is so easy," Miss
Vernon said in her fine, large, beneficent way; "at
least in this case. The others I don't know."</p>

<p>Captain Morgan came and stood between his wife
and the visitor. To be sure it was to the fire he
went, by which he posted himself with his back to it,
as is the right of every Englishman. His countenance
wore a troubled look, very different from the happiness
of his wife's. He stood like a barrier between
them, a non-conductor intercepting the passage of
genial sentiment.</p>

<p>"My dear Catherine," he said, with a little formality,
"I don't wish to be unkind, nor to check your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
kindness; but you must recollect that though he is
poor Katie's boy, she, poor soul, had nothing to do
with the up-bringing of him, and that, in short, we
know nothing about him. It has been my principle,
as you know, of late years, to insist upon living my
own life."</p>

<p>"All that, my kind old uncle, is understood," said
Catherine. "There are a great many people, I
believe, who are better than their principles, and
you are one of them&mdash;that is all. I understand that
you know nothing about him. You are only a man,
which is a great drawback, but it is not to be helped:
<i>we</i> know, though we have seen no more of him than
you have. Isn't it so?"</p>

<p>She leaned forward a little, and looked across at
the old lady, who smiled and nodded in return. Old
Mrs. Morgan was not disturbed by her husband's
disagreement. It did not even make her angry.
She took it with perfect composure, beaming over
her own discovery of her grandson, and the additional
happiness it had brought.</p>

<p>"My old man," she said, "Catherine, has his own
ways of thinking, we all know that; and sometimes
he will act upon them, but most commonly not. One
thing I know, he will never shut his doors on his own
flesh and blood, nor deny his old wife what is her
greatest pleasure&mdash;the thing that has been wanting
to me all the time&mdash;all the time! I scarcely knew
what it was. And if the boy had been distant or
strange, or showed that he knew nothing about us,
still I should have been content. I would have said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
'Let him go; you were right, Rowley, and not I.'
But it is not so," the old lady went on after a pause,
"there's love in him. I remember when the girls
were married there was something I always seemed
to want, I found out what it was when the
first grandchild was born. It was to feel a baby in
my arms again&mdash;that was what I wanted. I don't
know, Catherine," she added with humility, "if you
will think that foolish?"</p>

<p>"If I will understand&mdash;that is what you are
doubtful of&mdash;for I am an old maid, and never had,
so to speak, a baby in my arms; but I do understand,"
said Catherine, with a little moisture in her
eyes. "Well, and this great handsome fellow, a
man of the world, is he your baby that you wanted
so much?"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said the old captain. "The great
advantage of being an old maid, as you say, is that
you are above the prejudices of parentage. It is
possible to get you to hear reason. Why should
my life be overshadowed permanently by the action
of another? That is what I ask. Why should I
be responsible for one who is not me, nor of my
mind?"</p>

<p>"Listen to him! You would think that was all
he knows," said Mrs. Morgan; "there is no
fathoming that old man, my dear."</p>

<p>"What I have to say is, that we know nothing
of this young man," said the captain, shaking his
shaggy head as if to shake off his wife's comments.
"You will exercise your own judgment&mdash;but don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
take him on mine, for I don't know him. He is
well enough to look at; he has plenty to say for
himself; I dare say he is clever enough. Form
your own judgment and act upon that, but don't
come and say it's our fault if he disappoints you&mdash;that
is all I have to say. Excuse me, Catherine,
if I take a walk even while you are here, for this
puts me out&mdash;I allow it puts me out," Captain
Morgan said.</p>

<p>"What has made him take this idea?" said
Miss Vernon, when Captain Morgan had hobbled
out.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, he has his fancies like another.
We have had many things to put up with, and he
thinks when it comes to the second generation&mdash;he
thinks we have a right to peace and quiet in
our old age."</p>

<p>"And so you have," said Catherine gravely, "so
you have."</p>

<p>She did not ask any questions. Neither she nor
any one knew what it was with which, in the other
part of their lives, these old people had been compelled
to "put up." Nor did the old lady say.
She answered softly, "Yes, I think so too. Peace
is sweet, but it is not life."</p>

<p>"Some people would say it was better."</p>

<p>"They never knew, those people, what life was.
I like to see the children come and go&mdash;one here,
one there. One in need of your sympathy, another
of your help, another, oh Catherine, even that&mdash;of
your pardon, my dear!" This made her pause,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and brought, what was so unusual, a little glistening
moisture to the old lady's eyes. She was silent for
a moment, and smiled, perhaps to efface the impression
she had made. "If you can do nothing
else for them you can always do that," she said.</p>

<p>Catherine Vernon, who was sixty-five, and knew
herself to be an old woman, looked at the other, who
was over eighty, as a girl looks at her mother&mdash;wondering
at her strange experiences, feeling herself
a child in presence of a knowledge which is not hers.
She had not experience enough to understand this
philosophy. She looked for a little at her companion,
wondering, and then she said, soothingly&mdash;</p>

<p>"We must not dwell upon painful subjects. This
young fellow will not appeal to you so. What I
like in him is his independence. He has his own
opinion, and he expresses it freely. His society will
be very good for my nephew Edward. If he has
a fault&mdash;and, indeed, I don't think that boy has
many&mdash;it is that he is diffident about his own
opinion. Roland, if he stays long enough, will
help to cure him of that. And how does the other
affair go on?" she added, with a perceptible pause,
and in a voice which was a little constrained. "No
doubt there is great triumph next door."</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Morgan shook her head.</p>

<p>"It is curious what mistakes we all make," she
said.</p>

<p>"Mistakes? Do you mean that I am mistaken
about the triumph? Well, they have very good
reason. I should triumph too, if having been turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
out of a great house, like Mrs. John, I managed to
get back again, and recover all that I had lost by
means of a thing so entirely my own creation as a
daughter. Even a son would have been different&mdash;I
suppose. You know I am not a judge on that
point," Catherine said with a laugh.</p>

<p>The old lady continued to shake her head
slowly.</p>

<p>"The only one that has not made a mistake is
Harry. If he could have got what he wanted, it
would have been the best thing that could have
happened. There is no complication about that.
For him it would have been the best."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," said Catherine, her eyes
lighting up with that fire of curiosity and interest
which overcomes even the languor of age. "Do
you mean to say that&mdash;he is not to get what he
wishes? Oh, this is too much! That girl is eaten
up with pride. What is she saving herself for, I
wonder? What can she expect?"</p>

<p>Again old Mrs. Morgan shook her head, smiling
softly as at blunders upon which she could not be
too severe.</p>

<p>"I have said already what mistakes we make,
Catherine! often in our own career, always about
other people, my dear."</p>

<p>Upon this Catherine laughed, not having, though
she esteemed her old relation greatly, as much respect
for her judgment as probably it deserved. Miss
Vernon was too sensible a woman either to feel
or express any contempt for her own sex, as clever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
women who were not sensible used to do in those
days; but there was an undertone in her mind of
indifference, to say the least, of another woman's
opinion. She had a feeling that it could not be
any better, and most likely was not so good, as
her own, for she had held a position not usual
among women, and knew that not many would
have proved equal to the emergency as she did.
What the old captain said would have impressed
her more than what his wife said, and this although
she was perfectly aware that the old lady in many
cases was considered the most judicious of the two.</p>

<p>"I know you are both fanatics for Hester," she
said, "who is not my favourite as she is yours.
You must take care that Roland does not fall a
victim to her. There are few girls about, and in
that case, when young men have a mind to make
fools of themselves, there is no choice. Do not
shake your kind head off; you know this is a
thing in which we have agreed we shall never
think alike."</p>

<p>"Never is a long day," said the old lady, tranquilly.
She was well used to waiting. In her
experience, so many things had come to pass which
no one expected. Even now, she said to herself,
if any one had told her that Roland Ashton would
one day be under her roof&mdash;She added quietly,
"You are too much alike to do each other
justice."</p>

<p>At this Catherine grew red. It had been intimated
to her before, and she had scarcely been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
able to support the imputation. But she mastered
herself with an effort. Nowhere perhaps but in
this house would she have done so; but these
old people had an ascendency over her which she
could not explain.</p>

<p>"We will say nothing on that point," she said,
quickly. "Your news has taken me so completely
by surprise. Are you sure of it? Why should
Mrs. John's daughter have rejected so excellent a
settlement? She is looking for something better,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I think that was a mistake too," said the old
lady. "She says herself that Harry, though he is
not clever, is good and true. Ah! it is you who
shake your head now. In some things even our
Catherine fails; he is not the equal of Hester; but
it is not my opinion that a man need be always
superior to his wife. Where there is love, it does
not matter. I should have been pleased to see it;
but she is young; she thinks differently. She is
looking for nothing consciously; but in her heart
for love, which is the visitor one is always looking
for when one is young."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said Catherine; "it is the old people
that are romantic, not the young. It is the settlements
that are the things to be considered; or
perhaps she is thinking of a title? Her mother is
capable of any nonsense," she said with a scornful
laugh.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morgan made no reply. Her peaceful aspect
with her folded hands, the soft little smile on her old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
mouth, the slight shake of the head, was perhaps a
trial of patience for the other, who felt herself thrown
back into the category of the young and superficial
by this calm expectation and quietness. Catherine
Vernon was still in the region of prejudice and dislike.
She had not lived into that superior sphere of
toleration and calm. Impatience filled her veins. But
she mastered herself, the atmosphere subduing her.
And Captain Morgan came hobbling back, having
calmed himself down too.</p>

<p>"Ellen has come back," said Miss Vernon, to
change the subject, "from Paris, with clothes enough
for all the neighbourhood. It amuses me to think of
her among the bonnet-shops. What true enjoyment!
and scarcely less now to show them to all her friends.
Now there is a pleasure you cannot enjoy, uncle. A
man could not call his friends together to look at
his new hats."</p>

<p>"There is no telling what a young man can do in
the way of folly till he is put to it," said the captain.
"I am loth to recognise any inferiority. What do
you think about all these failures, Catherine? or
rather, if you have withdrawn from it, what do the
boys think?"</p>

<p>"I hope I am still capable of giving an opinion,"
said Miss Vernon. "None of them touch us, which
is the chief thing. For my part, speculation in this
wild way is my horror. If you could see the proposals
that used to be put before me! Not an undertaking
that was not the safest and the surest in
the world! The boys are well indoctrinated in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
opinions on that subject. They know better, I hope,
than to snatch at a high percentage; and love the
substance, the good honest capital, which I love. I
think," she continued, "there is a little of a miser in
me, or perhaps you will say in all women. I love to
see my money&mdash;to count it over like the&mdash;&mdash; By the
way, it was the king that did that while the queen
was eating her bread and honey. That goes against
my theory."</p>

<p>"A good many things go against your theory.
They say that there are no such wild speculators as
women. It seems easy to them that a sort of miracle
should happen; that something should come out of
nothing."</p>

<p>"They have not had my experience," said Catherine.
"But Edward and Harry are as steady as two churches;
that is," she added with a complacency which they
all recollected afterwards, "Edward is the head; the
other fortunately has the good sense not to attempt
to think for himself."</p>

<p>"Hester would have done that for him," said
Mrs. Morgan, in an undertone; but Catherine caught
it and went on with heightened colour, for the idea
that Hester&mdash;<i>that</i> girl!&mdash;might have had something
to say in the government of the bank, struck her as
if some one had given her a blow.</p>

<p>"Edward is the heart and soul of everything,"
she said. "How fortunate it was for me that my
choice fell upon that boy. I should say he had an
old head on young shoulders, but that I don't like
the conjunction. He is young enough. He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
always been accustomed to family life, and loves his
home."</p>

<p>"It is, no doubt," said Captain Morgan, kindly,
"that he has had the advantage of your own experience
and teaching more than the other, Catherine."</p>

<p>"That would be a delightful thought for me,"
Miss Vernon said with a suffusion of pleasure in her
eyes. "Perhaps there is some truth in it. I have
done my best to share my lights, such as they are,
with him; but he goes beyond me. And to think
that I hesitated between Edward and Harry! I hope
I am grateful to Providence that turned me to the
best. The other family are following out their lot
quite characteristically. Ellen's husband has a good
deal of worldly sense, which is wanting to that bit
of a butterfly. He is trying hard to get her to make
up to me. She has come to see me twice, full of
pretty speeches about Algy's great respect for me.
Human nature," said Catherine with a laugh, "is as
good, nay, far better, than a play. How cunning it
thinks it is, but in reality how very easy to see
through."</p>

<p>Here old Mrs. Morgan began to shake her head
again, smiling always, but with an indulgent, gentle
contradictoriness which was more near making Miss
Vernon angry than anything she had encountered
in this house before.</p>

<p>"What does she sit there for, like a Chinese idol?"
said the captain. "She has a wonderful opinion
of herself, that old woman. Human nature may be
easy to see through, but it is very hard to understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Catherine. What is that the Bible says about
'deceitful above all things'? When you try to get
hold of yourself, did you ever find a more slippery
customer? There's a kind of amusement in it, when
you are up to all your own dodges."</p>

<p>"Rowley, my dear!" said the old lady, surprised.</p>

<p>"It is true I am too old for slang: but one picks
it up, and sometimes it is happy enough. I say
when you are up to your own dodges; but that is
difficult, and takes a great deal of time. To find
yourself trotting forth the same old pretences that
you did at twenty, attempting to throw the same sort
of dust in your own eyes, is wonderful. There is a
sort of artlessness in the artifice that is amusing, as
you say; but it is only amusing when you are strong
enough to get the upper hand."</p>

<p>"When which of you gets the upper hand? for
there seem to be two of you," said Catherine, not
so much amused in her own person as she made a
pretence of being&mdash;for this was certainly not her view.</p>

<p>"To be sure," said the old captain, "there are two
of you, we all know that; and in most cases one of
you a very silly fellow, taken in on every hand, while
the other man sniggers in his sleeve. Of course I am
speaking from my own side&mdash;ladies may be different
from anything I know. But after all," he went on,
"I don't think so; for I've been a woman myself,
so to speak, through <i>her</i>, for sixty years&mdash;that is a
long spell. I don't see much difference, though in
some things she has got to the last word sooner
than I."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think we mean different things," said Catherine,
rising; "that was not the view I was taking. Yours
is better in the moral aspect, for I suppose it is more
profitable to judge ourselves than others; but one
cannot always be studying one's self."</p>

<p>There was a half-apology in her tone, and at the
same time a half-impatience. She did not desire to
be turned from the comedy which she had in her
way enjoyed for years, seeing through, as she said, all
the little world of dependents that hung about her,
drawing out their weaknesses, perceiving the bitter
grudge that lay under their exterior of smiles, and
the thousand ways in which they made up to themselves
for the humiliation of being in her debt&mdash;in
order to turn to what might prove the less amusing
contemplation of her own weaknesses, or recognise
the element of evil in that which was certainly not
amusing. Her carriage was standing at the gate
which admitted to the garden front of the Vernonry,
and it was with a sense of comfort that she got rid
of the old captain at his door, and threw a keen,
half-laughing glance at the windows on the other
side. Mr. Mildmay Vernon was making himself
very uncomfortable at the only angle of his room
which permitted him to see the gate, watching for
her exit. He kissed his hand to her as she paused
and looked round before getting into the carriage,
and Catherine realised as if she had seen it, the
snarl of mockery with which this salutation was
accompanied. In the intervening space were the
two sisters keeping the most vigilant watch for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
reappearance, counting the minutes which she spent
on the other side of the house, and saying ill-natured
things to each other as they nodded and waved their
hands. She was aware of the very tone in which
these speeches would be made, as well as if she had
heard them, and it gave her a great sense of enjoyment
to reflect that they were all sitting in rooms
well warmed and carefully kept, and full of benevolent
prevision of all their wants, while they thus
permitted themselves to sneer and snarl at the
bestower. Just as she drove away, Hester by chance
opened the verandah door, and came out to gather
some of the leaves of the Virginia creeper which
were dropping with every blast. Hester's serious
eyes met hers with scarcely any greeting at all on
either side. Catherine did not know very well how
it was that this girl came into the comedy. Had
she been Harry's betrothed, Miss Vernon could
have understood it, and though she could not but
have felt the triumph of her old rival, yet it would
have added delightfully to the commonplace drama
in which everybody pursued their own mean ends
under high-sounding pretences. She would have
been able to smile at the commonplace young fellow
taken in by the delusion that he was loved for himself,
and laugh in the conviction that Harry's was
no deep affection to be wounded, but that he could
quite well take care of himself, and that between
these two it would be diamond cutting diamond.
But the present state of affairs she did not understand.
All that was amusing in it was the doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
unbounded disappointment of the scheming little
mother, who thus must find all her fine schemes
collapsing in her hands. She could not refrain from
mentioning the matter at dinner that evening, though
Edward had a little failed on the former occasion, in
that backing up of all her opinions and feelings
which she had been accustomed to expect from
him.</p>

<p>"I find there is to be no match such as that we
were speaking of," she said. "Harry has either
drawn back or he is refused. Perhaps it may be
that he has thought better of it," she added suddenly,
without premeditation, grudging, as perhaps was
natural, to let her young antagonist carry off the
honours of the day.</p>

<p>"I thought it was not quite so certain as people
seemed to believe."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that Harry would persevere?"</p>

<p>"I mean that she would accept him, Aunt
Catherine. She is not a girl, so far as I can judge,
of whom one could ever be so sure."</p>

<p>"In the name of wonder," cried out Miss Vernon,
"what does she expect? Good heavens! where is
she to get another such chance again? To refuse
Harry, for a girl in her position, is madness. Where
does she think she will get another such offer?
Upon my word," said Catherine, with a little laugh,
"I can scarcely help being sorry for her poor little
mother. Such a disappointment for Mrs. John&mdash;her
White House and her recovered 'position' that she
loves so dearly, and all her comforts&mdash;I could find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
it in my heart to be very sorry for her," she said,
with another little laugh.</p>

<p>Edward gave a glance up at her from his plate,
on which he had the air of being intent. The young
man thought he saw through Catherine, as she
thought she saw through all the other inmates of
her little world. What he did see through was the
superficial badness which her position had made,
but he had not so much as a glimmering of the
other Catherine, the nobler creature who stood
behind; and though he smiled and assented, a
sensation of disgust came into his heart. He, too,
had his comedy of human nature, which secretly,
under cover of his complacency and agreement with
Catherine's opinion, he regarded with the bitterest
and angriest scorn. What an extraordinary shock
would it have been for his companion, who felt
herself to sit in the place of the audience, seeing
the puppets play their pranks upon the stage and
exhibit all their fooleries, to know that she herself
was the actor, turned outside in and seen through
in all her devices, to this boy whom she loved!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<h3>A FAMILY PARTY.</h3>


<p>"A grandson of Captain Morgan! Well, that
is not much to meet us at our wedding dinner&mdash;at
least, if it is not our wedding dinner&mdash;Oh, I know
there was our state one, and we met all the old
fogies whom I detest!" cried Mrs. Algernon Merridew,
born Ellen Vernon; "but this is only the
second, and the second is quite as important as the
first. She should have asked the county first, to
introduce us properly&mdash;and then the town; but
Aunt Catherine is one of the people who never do
what's expected of them. Besides, I don't want to
meet her relations on the other side. They're nobodies.
She spends quantities of money upon them
which she has no business to do, seeing it's the
Vernons' money and not hers at all, if you come
to that."</p>

<p>"Come, Nell," said her husband with a laugh.
He was a dark young man, as was to be expected&mdash;seeing
that she was so fair a young woman&mdash;good-looking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
with whiskers, which were the fashion in
those days, of a bushy blackness, and hair which
suggested pomade. "Come, Nell," he said, "strike
fair. Catherine Vernon does a great deal of good
with her money, and doesn't spare upon the Vernons&mdash;all
the town knows that."</p>

<p>"Oh no, she doesn't spare upon the Vernons&mdash;all
those useless old creatures that she has up there in
that horrid old-fashioned house! I think if she did
a little more for real relations, and left those old
fogies alone, it would be more like&mdash;&mdash; Expecting
one to call upon them, and take all sorts of trouble!
And look at poor old Harry kept with his nose at
his desk for ever."</p>

<p>"Poor old Harry is very lucky, I think. Fair
play is a jewel. If she doesn't do all you want,
who do you expect would?"</p>

<p>"You, of course!" cried Ellen, as was natural:
and they were so newly married that he thought it
very pretty; "that is the good of you; and if you
go in for Aunt Catherine too, when you know I
can't endure her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course the good of me is to do whatever you
want," he said, with various honeymoon demonstrations;
"but as for going in for Aunt Catherine&mdash;you
must know this, Nelly, that I'm very proud of
being connected with Catherine Vernon. I have
heard of her all my life as a sort of goddess, you
know. You must not put me off it all at once&mdash;I
couldn't be put off it. There now, there's nothing
to look sulky about."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are such an old Redborough person," Ellen
said, with a little pout: which was very true. He
was not, indeed, at all a good match for a Vernon;
but his whiskers&mdash;things much admired in those days&mdash;and
her self-will had worsted all opposition. He
was no more than the son of the perfectly respectable
and very well-to-do solicitor, who was universally
respected in Redborough, and though Algernon had
been in town and sown his wild oats, he had never
entirely got out of his mind the instinctive conviction
that Redborough was the centre of the world;
and to feel himself within the charmed circle in
which Catherine Vernon moved was a promotion
which was intoxicating to the young man. Not
even his devotion to his pretty wife, which was
great, could bring him to disown that allegiance
to Catherine Vernon which every Redborough man
was born with. It was a sort of still more intoxicating
proof of the dignity he had come to, that the
pretty wife herself turned up her little nose at
Catherine. That Mrs. Algernon should be so
familiar with the highest excellence known to
them, as to venture to do this, was to the whole
family of the Merridews an admiration&mdash;just as a
family entirely loyal might be flattered by having
a princess among them who should permit herself to
laugh at the majesty of the king; but this did not
shake their own fidelity. And Algernon, though he
ventured with bated breath to say "Aunt Catherine"
when he spoke of her in his own family, had not
got over his veneration for Miss Vernon. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
taken her in to dinner on the occasion of the great
banquet, which Ellen described so lightly, with a
sensation bordering upon the hysterical. Rapture,
and pride, and panic were in it. He did not know,
according to the vulgar description, whether he were
on his head or his heels, and his voice made a
buzzing in his own ears as he talked. The second
time was to be in the intimacy of the domestic
circle&mdash;if it had been to meet a crossing-sweeper it
would still have been a bewildering gratification;
but all the more, his wife's criticism and her indifference,
and even discontent with the notice which
to him seemed so overpowering an honour, pleased
the young man. She felt herself every bit as good
as Catherine, and yet she was his&mdash;Mrs. Algernon
Merridew! The thought was one adapted to make
his head swim with pride and delight.</p>

<p>It was entirely a family party, as Catherine had
said, and a very small one. The Miss Vernon-Ridgways
had been invited, to make the number even,
and their preparations for the unusual honour had
taken up four days at least. When they sailed into
the drawing-room at the Grange, having spent ten
minutes in shaking out the flounces and arranging
the flowers and ribbons with which they were ornamented,
it would be impossible to attempt to describe
the disgust of the bride. She turned her eyes upon
her husband, who for his part was in a state of
beatitude not to be disturbed by trifles, with a look
of indignant rage which he did not understand. "To
think she should ask those old things to meet <i>us!</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
I declare I have a great mind to go right away," she
whispered to Harry, who was more sympathetic.
Harry allowed that it was almost beyond bearing.
"But I wouldn't make a quarrel if I were you," he
said. In the meantime the sisters went up beaming
to their dear Catherine, whom they kissed with
devotion. How well she was looking! how becoming
her dress was! but that lovely lace would be becoming
to any one! they cried. Catherine received all
these compliments with a smile, and she took great
pleasure in Ellen's disgust, and the way in which she
turned her ear instead of her cheek to the salutations
of the cousins, who were rapturous in their admiration
of her in all her bridal finery. The entry of the
stranger, who was unknown to any of them, made a
diversion. Roland Ashton, when he was visible in
the full light of Miss Vernon's drawing-room, turned
out, in appearance at least, a very valuable addition
to the society. Ellen, who was critical, and inclined
by nature to a poor opinion of old Captain Morgan's
grandson, looked at him with astonished, and indeed
reluctant, approval. His whiskers were not so thick
or so black as Algernon's; but he had a fine mass of
dark hair, wavy, and rather longer than is now permitted
by fashion, fine features and dark eyes, with
a paleness which was considered very interesting in
those days. He was much taller and of more imposing
aspect than Edward, whose stature was not
great; he was far more intellectual than Harry;
altogether of the four young men present, his was
no doubt the most noticeable figure. They all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
appraised him mentally as he came in&mdash;Catherine
first of all, with a sensation of pride that the one
individual who was her relation, without being the
relation of her family, was a creditable novelty to introduce
among them; the others, with various degrees
of quickened curiosity and grudging. The grudge was
intensified in the persons of the sisters, who could
not endure this interloper. They had felt it their
duty to draw the line at the Morgans long ago, and
it was all they could do to behave with propriety at
Catherine's table when they were seated beside the
descendant of the old people on whom Catherine
spent her money in what they felt to be an entirely
unjustifiable way. They were the only persons present
who kept up their grudge to the end. In
Ellen's case it disappeared with the clear perception
of his good looks. But when Mr. Ashton offered his
arm to Miss Matilda Vernon-Ridgway, the look with
which she received the offered courtesy was enough
to freeze any adventurous young man into stone.
It did not, however. It made him all but laugh as
he glanced at Catherine, who for her part contemplated
her cousins with much gratification. Miss
Matilda placed the end of her finger upon the young
man's arm. She kept at as great a distance as
possible as she crossed the hall by his side. To the
little speech about the weather, which he thought
it his duty to make her, she returned a sort of
inarticulate reply&mdash;a monosyllable, but conveying no
meaning. When she was seated at table she flung
herself, so to speak, upon her neighbour at the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
side, who, as it happened, was Harry Vernon, and
who was not prepared for the honour. All this was
to Catherine as good as a play.</p>

<p>"What a climate, and what a poky old place this
Redborough is," said Ellen, preparing to lead the
conversation, as she finished her soup. She spoke
apparently to Edward, but in reality to the company,
which was not too large for general conversation.
"It is dreadful to come back here in the beginning
of winter from Abroad. I declare I quite envy you,
you people who have never been Abroad; you don't
know the difference. Bright sunshine all day long,
and bands playing, and the best of music, and all
your friends to talk to, sitting out under the trees.
Compare that with Redborough, where, beyond a
few tiresome little dinner parties, and perhaps three
dances at Christmas&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The White House used to be a great addition to
the cheerfulness of the place," said Edward. "Harry
will have no heart to keep it up by himself now you
have left him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry shall marry," said Ellen, "I have
made up my mind to that; and as soon as we have
got quite settled, I mean to set things a-going. I
mean to have a Thursday, Aunt Catherine. We
shall be glad if you'll come. It is to be a <i>Th&eacute;
Dansante</i>, which is quite a novelty here. You learn
so much better about all these things Abroad."</p>

<p>"Where is Abroad?" said Roland, in an undertone
which was so confidential and intimate, that
had he been anybody else, Miss Matilda must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
yielded to its seduction. As it was, she only gave
him a look of surprise at his ignorance, and cleared
her throat and shook her bracelets in order to be
able to strike in.</p>

<p>"A <i>Th&eacute; Dansante</i> is exactly the kind of entertainment
that suits me," Catherine said.</p>

<p>"Yes, won't it be nice?" said Ellen, unconscious.
"I learnt all the figures of the <i>cotillion</i>, which is the
most amusing thing to end up with, and I made Algy
learn it. As soon as ever our house is ready we shall
start. It will be a new feature in society. As for
Harry, till he's married he'll have to be content with
bachelor's dinners, for I can't always be leaving Algy
to look after him."</p>

<p>Here Harry murmured something, stammering,
and with a blush, to the intent that the bachelor's
dinners would last a long time.</p>

<p>"We don't see you so often at our place as we used
to do, Mr. Harry," said Miss Matilda, sweetly. "It
used to be quite a pleasure to watch for you; and
the summer evenings were so tempting, weren't they?
Oh, fie! it is very naughty to love and to ride away.
We always said that was what was likely to happen,
didn't we?" she said to her sister, on the other side
of the table.</p>

<p>Miss Martha nodded and smiled in return, and
cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, always," in a shriller tone.</p>

<p>"What's that you thought likely to happen?
Then it didn't happen if it was Harry," cried Ellen,
instinctively, ranging herself on her brother's side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"But about this <i>cotillion</i>?" said Edward. "What
is it? I thought it had something to say to a lady's
dress. I am sure it had in the eighteenth century.
We shall have to go to school to learn what your
novelty means."</p>

<p>"She put me to school, I can tell you," cried
Algernon, from the other end of the table. "I had
to work! She is the most dreadful little tyrant,
though she looks so soft."</p>

<p>"Dancing is neglected shamefully nowadays," said
Miss Matilda; "shamefully! We were taught very
differently. Don't you remember, dear, Mousheer
D'Egmont and his little violin, Martha? we were
taught the minuet first on account of our
curtseys&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, the funny, old-fashioned thing! You <i>never</i>
curtsey nowadays; even in the Lancers it is only a
bob," said Ellen, "or a bend mostly with your head.
You never see such a thing nowadays."</p>

<p>"My dear! In the presence of your sovereign,"
said Miss Matilda, with dignity, "it <i>always</i> continues
necessary. There is no change in that respect so far
as I am aware, Martha, is there? You were in the
habit of attending Drawing-rooms longer than I."</p>

<p>"Oh, never any change in that!" cried Miss
Martha, rising upon herself, so to speak, and erecting
her head as she looked from one end of the table
to another. It was not often that they had such a
triumph. They had been Presented. They had
made their curtseys to their Sovereign, as Miss
Matilda said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Silence fell upon the table, only broken by the
jingle of Ellen's bracelets, which she pushed up her
arm in her mortification; and there were so many of
them that they made a considerable noise. Even
she was cowed for the moment; and what was worse
was, that her husband being simple-minded, and
getting a little familiar with Catherine, now turned
his looks of awe and veneration upon the Miss
Vernon-Ridgways, who were so well acquainted with
the court and its ways.</p>

<p>And Catherine laughed.</p>

<p>"We are all behind in that respect," she said. "I
am fond of pomp and ceremonial for my part. It
is a pretty thing, but I like it best at a distance.
It is my fault, I have no doubt, that your wife
is ignorant of Drawing-rooms, Mr. Merridew."</p>

<p>"I always said so, Aunt Catherine," cried Ellen,
who was ready to cry, in the midst of her triumph.
"It is horrid for girls to have relations with those
out-of-the-way notions."</p>

<p>Catherine only laughed; it was her habitual
comment. She turned smiling to young Ashton by
her side.</p>

<p>"You ought not to dislike state," he said, in an
undertone; "you who are a kind of queen yourself&mdash;or,
shall I say, grand duchess&mdash;in your own town?"</p>

<p>"A queen without any subjects," said Catherine,
shaking her head. This time she did not laugh,
and there was even a little glimmer of sadness in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Not so. I am a stranger, you know. When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
go about the town, I hear of nothing but Catherine
Vernon. They call you so, do you know&mdash;<i>tout court</i>,
without miss or madam&mdash;that has a great effect upon
one's imagination."</p>

<p>Young Merridew had thrust forward his head, and
was listening, which perhaps was not very good
manners.</p>

<p>"It is quite true," he said eagerly. "Ellen says I
am a very Redborough person. I have been born
and bred here. I can't remember the time when
I didn't look up to&mdash;her, as if she was something
above the human&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And yet you have married a Vernon!" said
Catherine; but she was pleased. "It is not an uncommon
thing in this world," she said. "People at
a distance think more kindly of one than those who
are near; but this is not talk for a dinner-table.
Not to interfere with Ellen's <i>cotillion</i>" she said, in a
louder tone, "I am thinking of a party for Christmas,
young people. As it is for you, you must lay your
heads together, and decide what it is to be."</p>

<p>Then there arose a flutter of talk, chiefly maintained
by the ladies, but in which young Merridew
was appealed to by his wife; and Harry, stimulated
by the same hand, and Edward, mindful of his duties,
took part.</p>

<p>Catherine and her young relative were left, as it
were, alone, amid the babble of tongues.</p>

<p>"I cannot allow myself to look at it gravely," she
said. "I laugh; it is the best way. They all take
what they can get, but their opinions, if they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
individually weighed, of Catherine Vernon, would
surprise you. They don't think much of me. I dare
say I quite deserve it," she said, after a pause, with
another laugh. "Don't you think that in most cases
enthusiasm is confined to those people who personally
know the least of the object of it? That's an
awkward sentence, but never mind."</p>

<p>"Isn't it the same thing as to say that a great man
is never a hero to his valet, or that a prophet has no
honour in his own country?"</p>

<p>"Not the last, at least," said Catherine; "for being
no prophet, you yourself say I have got some honour
in my country. As for the valet, I don't know," she
continued, "but a maid, though she appraises you at
your true value, and is convinced you are a fool in
many things, still is not without a prejudice in your
favour. She would like, though she maintains her
erect position, to see the rest of the world bow down
before you. That is amusing too."</p>

<p>"You are a philosopher," said the stranger, looking
at her with a tender regard in his eyes, which
made a great impression generally upon younger
women, and moved even Catherine as with a sense
of kindness&mdash;of kindness disproportioned to their
actual knowledge of each other, which is a thing
which conciliates everybody, looking as if it implied
a particular attraction.</p>

<p>"Your grandfather thinks me a cynic," she said.
She liked these few words of quiet talk in the midst
of the mingled voices of the others, and was grateful
to the young man who looked so sympathetic. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
don't know that I am a cynic, but rather than cry, I
prefer to laugh. Is that cynicism?" He gave her
a look which would have no doubt had a great effect
upon the heart of a younger woman, and which
pleased Catherine, old as she was.</p>

<p>"I think it is true philosophy; but some of us
have feelings that will not be laughed at," said
Roland. He was accustomed to make great use of
his fine eyes, and on this occasion he did so with
the greatest effect. There could not have been
more tender sympathy than was in them. Could
he be really so much impressed by her character and
position, and the failure of true gratitude and kindness?
Catherine Vernon would probably have
laughed at any one else of her own age who had
been so easily persuaded; but it is always so much
more easy to believe in the sincerity of affection
which is called forth by one's self! Her eyes softened
as she looked at him.</p>

<p>"I think you and I, Roland, are going to be great
friends," she said, and then turned with a slight
little sigh, so small as to be almost imperceptible,
to the louder voices appealing to her. "You must
settle it among you," she said. "I give Edward
<i>carte blanche</i>. The only thing is that it must take in
everybody, all the Vernonry and our neighbours as
well&mdash;a real Christmas party."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you think, Aunt Catherine, Christmas
is such a bore!" said Ellen, "and family parties! Let
us have strangers. Let us have people we never set
eyes on before. Christmas is so vulgar! Look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
all the newspapers with their little stories; the
snow on the ground and the wanderer coming home,
and so forth. I am so glad we haven't got a
wanderer to come home."</p>

<p>"Christmas brings a great many duties I am
sure," said Miss Matilda. "Have you seen the
charity flannel at Roby's, Catherine? It is so good,
almost good enough to wear one's self; and the
blankets really look like blankets, not horse-cloths.
Do you think that is good or bad? What you give
in charity ought to be different, don't you think?
not to let them suppose they have a right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You forget," said her sister, eager to get in a
word, "that dear Catherine always gives the best."</p>

<p>"Ah! it is well to be Catherine," said Miss
Matilda, "but many people think there should be a
difference. What do you think, Mr. Harry? Catherine
may consider poor people's feelings; but there
are some who think it is wrong to do so&mdash;for who is
like Catherine? She is always giving. She is
always so considerate. Whatever she does is sure
to be the best way."</p>

<p>"I am certain," said Algernon Merridew beaming
with honest loyalty from where he sat by Miss
Vernon's side, "that all Redborough is of that
opinion; and Redborough ought to know."</p>

<p>"You mean all but the people to whom I give,"
said Catherine, "there are not so many of them:
but they are the best judges of all, and I don't think
they approve."</p>

<p>"There's nobody so unreasonable as the poor,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
said Ellen, "they are never satisfied. You should
just see them turning over the pieces from my
kitchen. Of course all the pieces are quite nice;
everything is, I hope, where I am housekeeper. Oh,
I know I am extravagant, I like the best of everything;
but nothing satisfies the poor. Cold potatoes
now with mayonnaise sauce are what I adore, but
<i>they</i> throw them away."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they don't have the mayonnaise sauce?"
suggested Edward.</p>

<p>"Oh, goodness! I hope not; that would be
simply immoral," cried Miss Matilda. "But, Mr.
Harry, you don't give your opinion, none of the
gentlemen give their opinion. Perhaps that is
because money is what they give, and one shilling
is just like another. You can't have charity shillings.
Oh, but I approve of charity flannel; and
some people always like to make a difference in
what they give to the poor. Poor ladies and gentlemen
soon find that out, I assure you. People give
you useful presents. If they want to invite you,
they invite you when there's nobody there. They
think a family dinner or high tea quite treat
enough for you. And quite right, don't you think,
when one is in the position of a dependent? It
keeps people in their proper places. Dear Catherine
buys the best flannel, better than I can afford,
for her Christmas gifts. She is never like other
people, always more liberal; but I should buy the
whitey-brown, that is, if I could afford any at all
you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't attack me, Matilda," said Catherine, with
a laugh, "all along the line."</p>

<p>"Oh, attack! <i>you</i>, dear Catherine? not for the
world. We all know what a friend you are. What
should we do without you? Whether we are in
Paris fashions or our old silks, don't we owe it all
to you?"</p>

<p>There was a little pause round the table which
was somewhat awkward; for what could anybody
say? The clever ones were all non-plussed, but
Harry, who was the stolid one, suddenly became
audible with his round rolling bass voice. "Whoever
says that, and whether it was well meant or not, I
say the same. It's all quite true. We owe everything
to Aunt Catherine. I am always ready to say
so, wherever I go."</p>

<p>"Have we come to Christmas toasts already?"
said Edward intervening. "We had better not start
that sort of thing before the time. We all know
what we owe to Aunt Catherine."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush," she cried, waving her hand to him
as she rose. "Now we shall release your noble
intellects from the necessity of coming down to our
level," Catherine said as she followed carefully Miss
Matilda's long train. It was very long, though it
was rather flimsy, and the progress of the ladies was
impeded by it. Ellen swept out lightly in advance
with a perfect command of hers. It was the first
time she had preceded the old cousins in her dignity
as a married woman, and the ring of her bracelets
sounded like a little trumpet-note. As she followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
them out Catherine Vernon returned to her habitual
mood of amused indulgence. She had been almost
sentimental for a moment, she said to herself, beguiled
by that boy's sympathetic eyes, which no doubt
he must make great use of among the young ones.
She laughed at herself not unpleasantly, to think of
the confidences she had almost been beguiled into.
But it pleased her to think that it was her mother's
blood which had exercised this influence upon her.
After all, it might be the Vernons only who were
sordid and ungrateful. The old captain and his wife
had always been exceptions to her sweeping judgment
of human nature. And now it was their
descendant who had touched her heart. Perhaps it
was only the Vernonry after all. But she was fully
restored to her usual kind of amusement as she
watched the progress of her three companions into
a temporary but eager intimacy on the score of
Ellen's Paris fashions which they were eager to examine.
The bride was as eager to exhibit as they
were to see, and was so well pleased with herself
as to be impervious to the little covert blows which
Miss Matilda gave under the shield of her flatteries.
Catherine Vernon established herself in her own
chair, and gathered her costly silken skirts about
her, and took up the newspaper, which people in the
country have to read in the evening instead of the
morning; but she did not read much. She was
diverted by the talk. "Crinoline is certainly going
out," said Ellen. "I heard it from the very best
shops. Look at mine, it is quite small, hardly to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
called crinoline at all. This is the very newest, from
the Grangd Magaseens du Louvre. You see yours
are twice as big," Ellen added, making a little
pirouette to exhibit the diminished proportions of
her hoops. The Miss Vernon-Ridgways looked down
upon their own skirts with unquiet eyes.</p>

<p>"The French are always so exaggerated," said
Miss Matilda. "Ignorant persons have such strange
ideas. They think really nice people in England
take their fashions straight out of Paris, but that is
quite a mistake. It has always to be modified by
English good taste&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ellen interrupted with a little shriek. "Oh, good
taste! You should just hear how they speak of that
Abroad. Sometimes I could have cried. They say
no woman knows how to dress herself in England.
And when I come back and see the dreadful things
that are worn here&mdash;&mdash; This is pretty," Ellen continued,
drawing attention to a portion of her dress.
"The Empress wore one just the same at a ball."</p>

<p>"Dear Ellen," said Miss Matilda, "and you wear
it at a little family party! that shows the difference.
I am sure it was done just to please us, to let us see
what the new fashions are, in your unselfish way,
dear!"</p>

<p>And Catherine laughed behind the newspaper.
The honours of the occasion were to the old sisters
after all.</p>

<p>In the meantime conversation of much more
serious import, though scarcely more elevated, was
going on round the table in the dining-room, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
young Ashton had got the lead, though none of the
others looked upon him with over-favourable eyes.
There was no doubt that he was a very handsome
fellow, and both Harry and Edward had that instinctive
sense that he was a competitor likely to
put them on their mettle, which is supposed to
influence the bosoms of women alone. They thought
(instinctively, and each in their different ways,) that
he must be a coxcomb. They divined that he was
the sort of fellow whom women admired, and scorned
him for it&mdash;as women perhaps now and then indulge
in a little sneer at a gentleman's beauty. But by
and by he touched a chord which vibrated more or
less in all their bosoms. He began to talk of the
city, for which country men of business have a
natural reverence. He revealed to them that he
himself was on the Stock Exchange, and incidentally
let fall an anecdote here and there, of the marvellous
incidents, the fairy tales of commerce, that were
taking place in those magic regions every day: of
men who woke in the morning with the most
moderate means at their command, and before night
were millionaires. They gathered close about him
as he added anecdote to anecdote. Edward Vernon
was like tinder, prepared for the fire; for all his
thoughts for some time past had been directed in
that way. And young Merridew was launching forth
upon life, rather more lavishly than was consistent
with his income and prospects. Harry was the least
interested of the three, but even to him the idea of
making a fortune in a few hours and being able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
retire to the country to give himself up to dogs and
horses, instead of going down to the bank every
morning, was a beatific suggestion. The present
writer does not pretend to be able to inform the
reader exactly how it was, or in favour of which
schemes, that the poet of the Stock Exchange
managed to influence these rustic imaginations, but
he did so. He filled their minds with an impatience
of their own slow business and its mild percentages,
even when he seemed to praise it.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it does feel slow work; I can't say.
I think it is a vast deal more wholesome. It is
very hard to keep your head steady, you know, when
you feel that the chances of an hour or two may
make you the richest man in England."</p>

<p>"Or the poorest perhaps?" said Edward, more
with the idea of subduing himself than checking this
flow of instruction.</p>

<p>"Ye-es," said Ashton, indifferently, "no doubt
that's on the cards: but it ought not to be if your
broker has a head on his shoulders. About the
worst that can happen, if you take proper precautions,
is that you're no worse than you were to
start with, and better luck next time. I don't
approve the 'gain or lose it all' system. But what
will Miss Vernon say if we stay here talking shop
all the evening?" he added.</p>

<p>There was never a more clever conclusion; it was
like the exciting close of an act in the theatre, for
he could not be persuaded to begin again. When
they went reluctantly into the drawing-room, Ellen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
thought her Algernon had taken too much wine;
and even Edward, who never offended the proprieties
in any way, had a curious light in his eyes, and did
not hear when he was spoken to. But Catherine
Vernon, for her part, did not notice anything except
the filial kindness of young Roland, and the
sympathy and understanding which shone in his
eyes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<h3>CONFIDENCES.</h3>


<p>"I would not speculate if I were you," said
Ashton. "What would be the good? You are
very well off as you are. You are making your
fortune steadily, far better than if you did it by a
successful <i>coup</i>. Yes, yes, I can understand that a
man should desire a little more excitement, and
rebel against the monotony of a quiet life, but not
you, Vernon, if you'll excuse my saying so. You
don't go in for any sort of illegitimate pursuit. You
don't play or bet; you have no claim upon you that
you want extraordinary means of supplying&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How can you tell all that?" said Edward
Vernon. "Do you think life's so easy a business
that you can read it off from the surface, and make
sure that everything is as it seems?"</p>

<p>"I don't say that. Of course, I go upon appearances.
I can understand that perhaps you are
tired of it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tired of it!" He twirled his stick violently
in his hand, hitting at the rusty bramble branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and gorse bushes that bordered the Common as if
they were his enemies. "I suppose one is apt to
tire of anything that lasts and never varies," he cried
with a forced laugh. "Yes, I am tired of it. Quiet
life and safe business, and the hope of making a
fortune, as you call it, steadily, in twenty or thirty
years&mdash;&mdash;Good life! Twenty or thirty years! Only
think of the number of days in that, one after the
other, one exactly like the other. I begin to feel as
if I should welcome anything to break the monotony&mdash;crime
itself."</p>

<p>"That means, old fellow," said Ashton, soothingly,
"nerves, and nothing more."</p>

<p>Edward laughed out, a laugh which was not
harmonious with the soft dulness of the autumnal
atmosphere. "I have no nerves, nor tastes nor
inclinations, nor any mind of my own," he said.
"I do what it is the right thing to do. Though
I am sick of it, I never show that. Nobody here
has the slightest idea that I was ever impatient or
irritable or weary in my life."</p>

<p>Ashton looked at him with some curiosity, but
took no further notice. "Does Miss Vernon," he
said, "take any share in the business of the bank&mdash;I
mean, in the work, in the regulations?"</p>

<p>"Miss Vernon," said Edward, "takes a share in
everything that is going on around her, it does not
matter what. She has been so long used to be at
the head of everything, that she thinks it her
natural place; and, as she is old and a woman, it
stands to reason&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"But she is a very intelligent woman; and she
must have a great deal of experience."</p>

<p>"The experience of a little country town, and of
steady business, as you call it&mdash;oh, she has all that.
But put your own views before her, or suggest even
the advantages of the circulation of money, quick
turning over, and balance of losses and gains&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can understand that," said Ashton, "You
don't appreciate the benefits of the Conservative
element, Vernon. But for you and your steady-going
banks, how could we operate at all? The
money must be somewhere. We can't play with
counters only in this game."</p>

<p>"There was no question of counters," said Edward;
"we have the money in our hands. It seems to me
that you and I should change places: you to do the
steady business here, and please Aunt Catherine&mdash;who
has taken a great fancy to you, you must know&mdash;I,
to watch the tide, how it comes and how it goes."</p>

<p>"There might be worse arrangements," Ashton
said with a laugh: but he added quickly, meeting a
keen, sudden glance from Edward, "if you could
transfer to me your training, and I mine to you. I
am counted rather bold sometimes, you must know,"
he added, after a moment, returning that look. They
talked with great apparent readiness and openness,
but with a curious dread of mutual observation
going on under the current of their talk all the time.</p>

<p>"So much the better," said Edward, "so long as
you know when to hold in."</p>

<p>They were going along the side of the Common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
between the Grange and the Vernonry. It was
Sunday afternoon&mdash;a dull day, the sky hanging low,
the green parts of the Common very green, glistening
with wetness, the gorse and brushwood very brown
and faded. Nobody was about on this day of leisure.
Even the slow country cart, the farmer's shandry,
the occasional roll of a carriage, was absent from the
silent road. There were no nursemaids and children
from Redborough picking their way along the side
path. Captain Morgan, feeling his rheumatism, had
retired to his chimney corner; the young men had it
all to themselves. Ashton had been lunching at the
Grange. He was on the eve of going back to town
to business, from which he declared he had been
absent far too long. The object of his visit was not
very clear to any one: he had left his grandparents
for years without showing so much interest in them.
But, whatever his motive had been, his expedition
had not been without fruit. He had discovered a new
and wealthy vein well worth working, and lit a fire
which, no doubt, would light up still further illuminations,
in some inflammable spirits. No one had
received him more warmly than Edward Vernon,
but he was less easy to make out than the others.
He was less simple; his life did not correspond with
the betrayals of his conversation, whereas neither
Harry Vernon nor his brother-in-law, had anything
to betray. What was evident, at least, was
that Catherine Vernon smiled upon the acquaintance
which had been formed so rapidly between
her nephew and the stranger. She called Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
"your cousin" to Ashton, then laughed and apologised,
explaining that where there were so many
cousins it was difficult to remember that her relation
was not Edward's too. When Ashton replied, "There
is connection enough to justify the name, if it is
agreeable to Vernon," there could be no doubt that
it was, at least, agreeable to her. She smiled upon
them from her window as they went out together,
waving her hand. And no foolish mother could have
been more unaware than Catherine, that the knowledge
that she was there, watching with tender looks
of affection the two figures as they went along, was
to Edward irksome beyond expression. He felt no
charm of love in the look, but substituted suspicion
for tenderness, and believed that she was watching
them, keeping them in sight as far as her eyes could
carry, to spy out all they did, and make for herself
an explanation of every gesture. He would not even
have twirled his stick and cut down the brambles
but in a momentary fit of forgetfulness. When they
got beyond her range, he breathed more freely, but,
even then, was not without a recollection that she
had her opera-glasses at hand, and might, through
them, be watching his demeanour still.</p>

<p>"Let us go this way," he said, turning into the
road, which slanted away on the nearer side of the
Vernonry, leading out into the open country and
brown fields.</p>

<p>Ashton hesitated a moment. "I am not sure that
I am not expected at home. It is my last day,"
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Home is a kind of irons," said Edward, "hand-cuffs,
ankle chains. One is always like an unhappy
cockatoo on a perch. Any little attempt at flight is
always pulled back."</p>

<p>"I don't think that is my experience. My old
people are very indulgent; but then, I am a mere
visitor. Home does not mean much to me," said
Ashton. If he had been in the presence of any lady
he would have sighed as he said this&mdash;being in
absolute freedom with one of his own kind he smiled,
and it was Edward who sighed.</p>

<p>"There is such a thing as having too much of it,"
he said. "What I suffer from is want of air. Don't
you perceive it? There is no atmosphere; every
breath has been breathed over and over again. We
want ventilation. We welcome every horror with
delight in consequence&mdash;a murder&mdash;or even a big
bankruptcy. I suppose that is why bankruptcies are
so common," he added, as if struck with the idea. "A
man requires a great deal of original impulse before
he will go the length of murder. The other has a
milder but similar attraction; you ruin other people,
which shakes them up, and gives a change of air."</p>

<p>"Ill-omened words," said Ashton, laughing, and
throwing out the fore-finger and little finger of his
right hand with a play at superstition. "Ugly at all
times, but especially when we are talking of business
and the Stock Exchange."</p>

<p>"Are you aware," said Edward, sinking his voice,
"that our predecessor, before Aunt Catherine, did
something of the kind?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"A certain John Vernon. His wife lives yonder,
with the rest of Aunt Catherine's dependents in that
red house. He found it too much for him; but it
was a poor sort of a flash in the pan, and hurt
nobody but himself."</p>

<p>"You would like to do more than that," said
Ashton, with a laugh.</p>

<p>But in Edward's face there was no jest.</p>

<p>"I should like," he said, "if I broke down, to
carry the whole concern along with me. I should
like to pull it down about their ears as Samson
pulled the temple, you know, upon his persecutors."</p>

<p>"Vernon," said Roland, "do you know that you
are very rash, opening out like this to me? Don't
you see it is quite possible I might betray you? I
have no right to preach, but surely you can't have
any reason to be so bitter. You seem tremendously
well off, I can tell you, to a friendless fellow
like me."</p>

<p>"I am very well off," said Edward, with a smile;
"no man was ever better. I came out of a struggling
family where I was to have gone to the colonies
or something. My next brother got that chance,
and here I am. John Vernon, so far as I can hear,
was an extravagant fool. I have not the least
sympathy with that. Money's a great power, but as
for fine houses, or fine furniture, or show or dash
as they call it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I told you," said Ashton, "you have no vice."</p>

<p>Edward gave him a dark, suspicious look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have even a contempt for it," he said.</p>

<p>"There are plenty of men who have that&mdash;a horror
even; and yet can't do without the excitement."</p>

<p>"I prefer your sort of excitement. John Vernon,
as I say, was a fool. He ran away, poor wretch, and
Catherine stepped in, and re-made everything, and
covered him with contempt."</p>

<p>"He is the father (is he dead?) of the&mdash;young
lady&mdash;who is such a favourite with my grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Hester? Oh, you know her, do you? One of
Aunt Catherine's pensioners in the Vernonry, as
she calls it."</p>

<p>"It is a little hard upon them to be called dependents;
my old people live there. They have their
own little income to live upon. Miss Vernon gives
them their house, I believe, which is very kind, but
not enough to justify the name of pensioners."</p>

<p>"That is our way here," said Edward laughing.
"We are very ready to give, but we like to take the
good of it. It is not respectful to call the place the
Vernonry, but we do it. We are delighted to be
kind; the more you will take from us, the better we
will like you. We even&mdash;rather like you to be
ungrateful. It satisfies our theory."</p>

<p>"Vernon, all that seems to me to be diabolical,
you know, I wish you wouldn't. Miss Hester is a
little of your way of thinking, I fear. She makes it
amusing though. There are parties, it appears,
where she stands all night in a corner, or looks
at photographs."</p>

<p>"She says that, does she?" said Edward. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
smile had not been a pleasant one, but now it
disappeared from his face. "And I suppose she tells
you that I never go near her? I have to look after
the old ladies and take them to supper. I have
the honour of standing in the position of master of
the house."</p>

<p>"I don't know that she blames any one," said Ashton
indifferently. "It is more fun than anger. Talk
of want of air, Vernon; that poor child wants air
if you please. She is as full of spirit and life as any
one I ever saw. She would like to do something."</p>

<p>"Something! What kind of something? Go on
the stage&mdash;or what?"</p>

<p>"I have never heard of the stage or anything of
the kind. She wants work."</p>

<p>"Excitement!" Edward said, with an impatient
gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p>"She is like you then," said Ashton, trying to
laugh, but not with much cordiality, for he felt
himself growing angry in spite of himself.</p>

<p>There was excitement enough now in Edward
Vernon's face. It grew dark with passion and
intolerance.</p>

<p>"A woman is altogether different," he said; then
subduing himself with a change in his voice from
rage to scorn, "she will soon have it in her power
to change all that. Don't you know she is going to
marry Harry Vernon?&mdash;an excellent match for her&mdash;money
and little brains&mdash;whereas she has much
brains and little money, the very thing in marriage,"
he concluded, with a harsh laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that so?" said Ashton.</p>

<p>He had been listening quite at his ease, turning
his face towards his companion, and it was a
satisfaction to Edward to see that the stranger's
countenance clouded over. He was astonished, and
Edward could not help hoping more than astonished&mdash;for
being sore and bitter himself he liked to see
another feel the sting.</p>

<p>"That's well," Roland said after a moment, "if
she likes it. I should not have thought&mdash;but a
week's acquaintance does not show you much of a
character. I am glad to hear it," he said, after a
pause, "if she likes it," which was but a dubious
sort of satisfaction after all.</p>

<p>Edward looked at him again with an expression of
gratified feeling. He was glad to have given his
new friend a little friendly stab. It pleased him to
see Roland wince. When one is very uneasy one's self,
that is always a little consolation. He looked at
him and enjoyed it, then turned away from the
subject which had given him this momentary
pleasure.</p>

<p>"Let us return to our muttons," he said. "Tell
me what you think of these papers? I put them
into my pocket to show you. Now that we are
fairly out of sight"&mdash;then he turned back to glance
along the still damp road, upon which there was not
a single shadow but their own&mdash;"and nobody can
spy upon us&mdash;for I distrust windows&mdash;we may think
of business a little," the young man said.</p>

<p>Ashton looked at him as he took the papers with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
glance as suspicious as his own. They had grown
into a sort of sudden intimacy in a single night.
Edward had been exactly in the state of mind to
which Roland's revelation of chances and possibilities
was as flame to tinder. To have his impatient desires
and longings made practical was everything to him,
and the prudence and business instinct left in him
which made him hesitate to make the plunge by
himself without skilled guidance, endowed the newcomer
with an importance which nothing else could
have given him. He was at home in those regions
which were so entrancing and exciting, yet strange
to Edward. These communications had brought
them to something like confidential friendship, and
yet they did not know each other, and in many
things were mutually antipathetic, repelling, rather
than attracting each other. This interview, though
it was to seal the connection between them, made
their mutual want of sympathy more apparent.
Edward had showed the worst side of himself, and
knew it. He felt even that his self-betrayal had
been so great as to put him almost in his companion's
power, while at the same time Ashton had impertinently
interposed in the family affairs (a point upon
which Edward was as susceptible as any one) by
what he had permitted himself to say about Hester.
Ashton, on the other hand, whose temper in a way
was generous and easy, regarded the fortunate but
ungrateful possessor of Catherine Vernon's sympathies
with an indignant astonishment. To have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
been so taken up by such a woman, to have her
affection, her confidence, her unbounded approbation
and trust, and to so repay her! It was incredible,
and the fellow was&mdash;&mdash; Should he fling up all his
pretence at sympathy with this cub, and go off at
once, rather abandoning the possible advantage than
consenting to ally himself with such a being? This
was the point at which they stood for a moment;
but beside the pull of mutual interest how were
they ever to explain the sudden breach, should they
follow their mutual inclinations and make one? It
would be necessary to say something, and what could
be said? and then there lay before Edward a world
of fabulous gain, of sudden wealth, of a hundred
excitements to which Roland seemed to hold the
key; and before Roland the consciousness that not
only the advantage of having Edward, but a whole
population of eager country people ready to put their
money into his hands, and give him such power of
immediate action as he had scarcely dreamt of,
depended upon his self-restraint. Accordingly the
sole evidence of their absolute distrust and dislike
of each other, was this mutual look, exchanged just
before they entered upon the closest relations of
mutual aid.</p>

<p>It was a curious scene for such a beginning. The
solitude of the country road was complete; there
was no one to interrupt them. Although they were
in the freedom of the open air, and subject to be
overtaken by any passer-by, yet the Sunday stillness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
was so intense that they might have been in the
most secret retirement on earth. Had they been
seated together in Edward's room at home, a hundred
disturbances were possible. Servants can never be
shut out; if it is only to mend the fire they will
appear in the middle of the most private conference.
And Catherine herself, all unconscious that her
presence was disagreeable, might have come to the
door to summon them, or perhaps even to bring them,
with her own kind hands, the cups of tea which in
his heart Edward loathed as one of the signs of his
slavery. They were the drink of bondage&mdash;those
poor cups that never inebriate. He hated even the
fragrance of them&mdash;the little steams ascending.
Thank Heaven no one could bring him tea out upon
the high road! The chill outer air, the faint scent
of mossy damp and decay, the dim atmosphere without
a sparkle in it, the absolute quiet, would have
better suited confidences of a different description.
But if business is not sentimental it is at least so
urgent and engrossing, that it becomes indifferent
to circumstances. The do-nothing calm of the
Sunday closed curiously around the group; their
rustling papers and eager countenances brought the
strangest interruption of restless life into the almost
dead and blank quiet. The season, the weather, the
hour, the brown quiescent fields in which for the
only moment of the year no mystery of growth was
going on, but only a silent waiting for the seeds and
the spring; this day of leisure when everything was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
at rest, all the surrounding circumstances united to
throw into full relief the strange centre to the
landscape&mdash;the two figures which brought a sharp
interest of life into this still-breathing atmosphere,
and waiting stagnation, and Sunday calm.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<h3>ROLAND.</h3>


<p>Roland Ashton had been in little doubt as to his
own motives when he came after so many years' indifference
to "look up" his old grandparents, and
take up late, yet not too late, the traditions of filial
duty. These traditions, indeed, had no existence for
this young man. His mother, the victim of a dissipated
and hopeless spendthrift, had died when her
children were young, and her father and mother had
stood aloof from all but the earliest years of the
handful of boys and girls she left behind. The
children scrambled up somehow, and, as is not unusual
among children, whom the squalor of a parent's
vice has disgusted from their earliest consciousness,
succeeded in doing well; the girls making much
better marriages than could have been hoped for;
the boys, flung into the world on their own account
at a very early age, finding the means of maintaining
themselves, and even pushing forward to a position as
good as that which their father had lost. That father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
had happily died and gone out of all power to injure
them, a number of years before, and it was only on a
rare visit to the elder sister, who alone knew much
about the family connections, that Roland had
learned something of the state of affairs at Redborough.</p>

<p>Elinor was old enough to remember the time when
the grandfather and grandmother had taken charge of
the little weeping band of babies in their far-off helpless
days, and she had kept up a certain correspondence
with them, when, half ruined by that effort, they were
saved by Catherine Vernon, the mysterious, wealthy
cousin, of whose name everybody in the family had
heard. Elinor remembered so many details when her
memory was jogged, that it occurred to Roland that
it would be a very good thing to go down to Redborough
and pay his grandfather a visit. Catherine
Vernon might turn out to be worth cultivating. She
had stepped in to save old Captain Morgan and his
wife from the consequences of their own liberality to
their daughter's children. She had a little colony of
pensioners about her, Elinor was informed. She was
very rich, so rich that she did not know what to do
with her money. There was a swarm of Vernons
round her, eating her up.</p>

<p>"We are her nearest relations on her mother's
side," Elinor had said. "I do not see why we should
not have our chance too. Don't forget us, Roland, if
you make any way; and you ought to do something;
for you have the right way with women," his sister
said, with some admiration and a little doubt. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
faith was that he was sure to succeed, her doubt
whether his success would be of use to anybody but
himself; but however it might turn out, it was
always better that one of the Ashtons should
benefit by Catherine Vernon's colossal fortune, than
that it should all go into the hands of the other
people.</p>

<p>Roland himself was well aware that he had the
right way with women. This was not the result of
art and calculation, but was pure nature. The young
man was bent upon his own ends, without much consideration,
in great matters, of other people. But in
small matters he was very considerate, and had a
delightful way of deferring to the comfort of those
about him. And he had the power of looking interested,
and even of feeling interested in everybody
he addressed. And he had fine eyes! What more is
needed to enable a young man to make his way with
women? He was very popular; he might have
married well had he chosen to take that step; indeed,
the chief thing against him was, that he had wavered
too long more than once, before he could make up his
mind to hurt the feelings of a sensitive girl by not
asking her to marry him. It was not, to be sure, his
fault, if they thought that was his meaning. A
prudent girl will never allow herself to think so until
she is asked point-blank; and when you came to investigate
each case, there really was nothing against
Roland. He had made himself agreeable, but then,
that was his way. He could not help making himself
agreeable. The very tone of his voice changed when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
he spoke to any woman who pleased him, and he was
very catholic in his tastes. Most women pleased him
if they had good looks, or even the remains of good
looks; or if they were clever; or even if they were
<i>nice</i>; and he was pleasant to all, old and young. The
quality was not without its dangers; but it had great
advantages. He came to Redborough fully determined
to make the conquest of Catherine Vernon,
whom, save that she was rich and benevolent, he
knew very little about. Very rich (according to
Elinor), rather foolishly benevolent, old&mdash;a young man
who has the right way with women could scarcely be
indifferent to such a description. He determined to
find an opportunity in the dull time of the year, when
business was not too exacting, to pay some of the
long over-due respect and gratitude which he owed
to his grandfather. Captain Morgan professed to have
cut himself clear of all his relationships, but it was
true that twenty years before, he had spent everything
he had, and deprived himself of every comfort,
he and his wife, for the maintenance of his daughter's
children. He had never got any return for this from
the children, who knew very little about him. And
it was full time that Roland should come with his
power of making himself agreeable to pay the family
debt&mdash;no harm if he did something for the family
fortunes by the way.</p>

<p>And it has been seen that the young man fully
proved, and at once, the justice of his sister's description
of him. His grandmother, to be sure, was vanquished
by his very name, by a resemblance which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
she found out in his mouth and eyelids to his
mother, and by the old love which had never been
extinguished, and could not be extinguished in her
motherly old bosom. But Hester, by a mere chance
encounter in the fire-light, without even seeing
him, without knowing his name, had been moved
to a degree of interest such as she was not conscious
of having ever felt before. And Catherine
Vernon had yielded at once, and without a struggle,
to his influence. This was delightful enough, but
after all it did not come to very much, for Roland
found himself plunged into the midst of a society
upon which he had not at all reckoned. The community
at the Vernonry was simple; he was prepared
for that, and understood it. But when he went to the
Grange and made acquaintance with the closer circle
there, the young men to whom Catherine had made
over the bank and all its interests, and especially
Edward, who was established as if he had been her
son, in her house, a change came over Roland's plans
and anticipations. He had a strong desire for his own
advantage, and inclination to follow that wherever it
might lead him; but he was not malignant in his
selfishness. He had no wish to interfere, unless it
proved to be absolutely necessary, with another man's
career, or to injure his fellow-creatures in promoting
his own interest. And it cannot be denied that he
felt a shock of disappointment which, as he found
when he reasoned with himself on the subject, was
somewhat unreasonable. How could he expect the
field to be clear for him, and the rich, childless woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
of fortune left at his mercy? As if there were not
crowds of other people in the world who had a quick
eye for their own advantage, and clear sight to see
who was likely to serve it! But these discoveries put
him out. They made his mission purposeless. They
reduced it to the mere visit to his grandfather, which
he had called it, but which he by no means intended
it solely to be.</p>

<p>After this first shock of disappointment, however,
Roland began to find himself at once amused and
interested by the new community, into the midst of
which he had dropped. The inmates of the Vernonry
were all simple enough. To be very poor and obliged
to accept favours from a rich relative, yet never to be
able to escape the sense of humiliation, and a grudge
against those who are better off&mdash;that is indeed too
general: and it is even a conventional necessity of
the imagination, that there should be bickerings
and private little spites among neighbours so closely
thrown together. Ashton did not see much of the
Miss Vernon-Ridgways, who had refused to know him
at Catherine's house, nor of their kindred spirit Mr.
Mildmay Vernon; but he could imagine them, and
did so easily. Nor was the gentle little widow, who
was now on one side now on the other, according as
the last speaker moved her, or the young heroine her
daughter, difficult to realise. But Catherine, and the
closer group of her relations, puzzled him more. That
she should gauge them all so exactly, yet go on with
them, pouring kindness upon their ungrateful heads
with a sort of amusement at their ingratitude, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
a malicious pleasure in it, surprised him less than
that among all who surrounded her there was no one
who gave to her a real and faithful devotion. And
her faith in Edward, whose impatience of her bonds
was the greatest of all, seemed to Roland in his
spectatorship so pitiful, that he could scarcely help
crying out against it to earth and heaven. He was
sorry for her all the more that she was so little sorry
for herself, and it seemed to him that of all her surroundings
he was the only one who was sorry for
Catherine. Even his old people as he called them,
did not fathom that curse of her loneliness. They
thought with everybody else that Edward was a true
son to her, studying her wishes, and thinking of nothing
so much as how to please her. It appalled him
when he thought of the snarl on Edward's lips, the
profound discontent in his soul. It would be cruel
above all things to warn her&mdash;she who felt herself so
clear-sighted&mdash;of the deception she was the victim of;
and yet what could it come to but unhappiness?
Roland felt himself overpowered and almost overawed
by this combination. Nobody but he, it seemed, had
divined it. He had walked back with Edward to the
Grange after their long talk and consultation, and had
taken off his hat with a smile of kindness to the
indistinct figure still seated in the window, which
Edward recognised with a secret grimace. To see her
seated there looking out for their return, was a
pleasure to the more genial spirit. It would have
pleased him to feel that there was some one who
would look out for his coming, who would watch him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
like this, with tenderness as he went away. But then
he had no experience of the kind in his own person,
and Edward perhaps had too much of it. While the
one went indoors with a bitter sense that he could go
nowhere without being watched, the other turned
away with a pleasant look back, waving his hand to
Catherine Vernon in the window. She was not likely
to adopt him, but she was kind to him, a pleasant,
handsome old woman, and a most creditable relative.
He was glad he had come if it were for that and no
more. There were other reasons too why Roland
should be glad he had come. He had found a new
client, nay, a group of new clients, by whose means he
could extend his business and his prospects&mdash;solid
people with real money to risk, not men of straw.
Though he was full of aspirations they were all of a
practical kind. He meant to make his fortune; he
meant to do the very best for his customers who
trusted him as well as for himself, and his spirits rose
when he thought what a power of extensive and
successful operation would be given him by the money
of all these new people who were so eager to face the
risks of speculation. They should not suffer by it;
their confidence in him should be repaid, and not only
his, but their fortunes would be made. The certainty
of this went to his head a little, like wine. It had
been well for him to come. It had been the most
important step he had ever taken in his life. It was
not what he had hoped for, and yet it was the thing
above all others that he wanted, a new start for him
in the world, and probably the turning-point of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
life. Other matters were small in comparison with
this, and approbation or disappointment has little to
do with a new customer in any branch of business.
As for other interests he might have taken up on the
way, the importance of them was nothing. Hester
was a pretty girl, and it was natural to him to have
an occupation of that sort in hand; but to suppose
that he was sufficiently interested to allow any thought
of her to beguile him from matters so much more
serious, would have been vain indeed. He felt just
such a momentary touch of pique in hearing that she
was going to be married, as a woman-beauty does
when she hears of any conquests but her own. If she
had seen him (Roland) first, she would not have been,
he felt, so easily won; but he laughed at himself for
the thought, as perhaps the woman-beauty would
scarcely have been moved to do.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<h3>WARNING.</h3>


<p>"I think, if you will let me, I will send down
Emma for a little fresh air and to make your
acquaintance, grandmother. She is rather of the
butterfly order of girls, but there is no harm in her.
And as it is likely that I shall have a good deal to
do with the Vernons&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you want with the Vernons? Why
should you have a good deal to do with them?"
asked Captain Morgan, hastily, and it must be added
rather testily, for the old man's usually placid humour
had been disturbed of late.</p>

<p>"In the most legitimate way," said Ashton. "You
can't wish me, now that I am just launched in business,
to shut my eyes to my own advantage. It will
be for their advantage too. They are going to be
customers of mine. When you have a man's money
to invest you have a good deal to do with him. I
shall have to come and go in all likelihood often."</p>

<p>"Your customers&mdash;and their money to invest&mdash;what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
do mean by that? I hope you haven't taken
advantage of my relationship with Catherine Vernon
to draw in those boys of hers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Grandfather," said Roland, with an <i>air digne</i>
which it was impossible not to respect, "if you think
a little you will see how injurious your words are.
I cannot for a moment suppose you mean them.
Catherine Vernon's boys, as you call them, are nearly
as old, and I suppose as capable of judging what is
for their advantage, as I am. If they choose to
entrust me with their business, is there any reason
why I should refuse it? I am glad to get everything
I can."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, there is a reason," said Captain Morgan.
"I know what speculation is. I know what happens
when a hot-headed young fellow gets a little bit of
success, and the gambling fever gets into his veins.
Edward Vernon is just the sort of fellow to fall
a victim. He is a morose, ill-tempered, bilious
being&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop," said Roland; "have a little consideration,
sir. There is no question of any victim."</p>

<p>"You are just a monomaniac, Rowley, my old
man," said Mrs. Morgan.</p>

<p>"I know everything you can say," said the old
captain. "All that jargon about watching the
market, and keeping a cool head, and running no
unnecessary risks&mdash;I know it all. You think you
can turn over your money, as you call it, always to
your advantage, and keep risk at arm's length."</p>

<p>"I do not say so much as that; but risk may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
reduced to a minimum, and profit be the rule, when one
gives one's mind to it&mdash;which it is my business to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know everything you can say," said the
old man. "Give your mind to it! Give your mind
to an honest trade, that's my advice to you. What
is it at the best but making money out of the follies
of your fellow-creatures? They take a panic and
you buy from them, to their certain loss, and then
they take a freak of enthusiasm and you sell to them,
to their certain loss. Somebody must always lose in
order that you should gain. It is a devilish trade&mdash;I
said so when I heard you had gone into it; but for
God's sake, Roland Ashton, keep that for the outside
world, and don't bring ruin and misery here."</p>

<p>"What can I say?" said the young man. He rose
up from the table where he had been taking his
last meal with the old people. He kept his temper
beautifully, Mrs. Morgan thought, with great pride
in him. He grew pale and a little excited, as was
natural, but never forgot his respect for his grandfather,
who, besides that venerable relationship, was
an old man. "What can I say? To tell you that I
consider my profession an honourable one would be
superfluous, for you can't imagine I should have
taken it up had I thought otherwise."</p>

<p>"Rowley, my old man," said Mrs. Morgan, "you
are just as hot-headed as when you were a boy.
But, Roland, you must remember that we have
suffered from it; and everybody says when you begin
to gamble in business, it is worse than any other
kind of gambling."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"When you begin; but there is no need ever to
begin, that I can see."</p>

<p>"And then, my dear&mdash;I am not taking up your
grandfather's view, but just telling you what he
means&mdash;then, my dear, Catherine Vernon has been
very kind to him and me. She is fond of us, I really
believe. She trusts us, which to her great hurt,
poor thing, she does to few&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Catherine Vernon is a noble character. She
has a fine nature. She has a scorn of meanness and
everything that is little&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The old lady shook her head, "That is true," she
said; "but it is her misfortune, poor thing, that she
gets her amusement out of all that, and she believes
in few. You must not, Roland," she said, laying her
hand upon his arm, "you must not, my dear lad&mdash;Oh,
listen to what my old man says! You must not
be the means of leading into imprudence or danger
any one she is fond of&mdash;she that has been so kind to
him and to me!"</p>

<p>The old hand was heavy on his arm, bending him
down towards her with an imperative clasp, and this
sudden appeal was so unexpected from the placid
old woman, who seemed to have outgrown all impassioned
feeling and lived only to soothe and reconcile
opposing influences, that both the young man and
the old were impressed by it. Roland Ashton stooped,
and kissed his grandmother's forehead. He had a
great power in him of response to every call of
emotion.</p>

<p>"Dear old mother," he said, "if I were a villain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and meant harm, I don't see how I could carry on
with it after that. But I want you to believe that
I am not a villain," he said, with a half-laugh of
feeling.</p>

<p>Old Captain Morgan was so touched by the scene
that in the weakness of old age and the unexpectedness
of this interposition the tears stood in his eyes.</p>

<p>"When you do put your shoulder to the wheel,
Mary," he said, with a half-laugh too, and holding
out a hand to Roland, with whom for the first time
he found himself in perfect sympathy, "you do it
like a hero. I'll add nothing to what she has said,
my boy. Even at the risk of losing a profit, or
failing in a stroke of business, respect the house that
has sheltered your family. That's what we both say."</p>

<p>"And I have answered, sir," said Roland, "that
even if I were bent on mischief I could not persist
after such an appeal&mdash;and I am not bent on mischief,"
he added, this time with a smile; and so fell
into easy conversation about his sister, and the good
it would do her to pay the old people a visit. "I am
out all day, and she is left to herself. It is dull for
her in a little house at Kilburn, all alone&mdash;though
she says she likes it," he went on, glad, as indeed
they all were, to get down to a milder level of
conversation.</p>

<p>The old captain had not taken kindly to the idea
of having Emma; but after the moment of sympathetic
emotion which they had all passed through,
there was no rejecting so very reasonable a petition.
And on the whole, looking back upon it, now that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
young man's portmanteau stood packed in the hall,
and he himself was on the eve of departure, even
the captain could not deny that there had been on
the whole more pleasure in Roland's visit than he
had at all expected. However he might modify the
account of his own sensations, it had certainly been
agreeable to meet a young fellow of his own blood,
his descendant, a man among the many women with
whom he was surrounded, and one who, even when
they disagreed, could support his opinions, and was
at least intelligent, whatever else. He had received
him with unfeigned reluctance, almost forgetting who
his mother was in bitter and strong realisation that
he was his father's son and bore his father's name.
But personal encounter had so softened everything,
that though Roland actually resembled his objectionable
father, the captain parted from him with regret.
And, after all, why should not Emma come? She
was a girl, which in itself softened everything (notwithstanding
that the captain had recognised as a
distinct element in Roland's favour that he was a
man, and so a most desirable interruption to the
flood of womankind&mdash;but nobody is bound to be consistent
in these matters). It was good of her brother,
as soon as he was afloat in the world, to take upon
himself the responsibility of providing for Emma,
and on the whole the captain, always ready to be
kind, saw no reason for refusing to be kind to this
lonely girl because she was of his own flesh and
blood. He drew much closer to his grandson during
these last few hours than he had done yet. He went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
out with him to make his adieux to Mrs. John and
her daughter. And Hester came forward to give
them her hand with that little enlargement about
the eyes, which was a sure sign of some emotion in
her mind. She had seen a great deal of Roland, and
his going away gave her a pang which she scarcely
explained to herself. It was so much life subtracted
from the scanty circle. She too, like Edward, felt
that she wanted air, and the departure of one who
had brought so much that was new into her restricted
existence was a loss&mdash;that was all. She had assured
herself so half-a-dozen times this morning&mdash;therefore
no doubt it was true. As for Roland, it was not in
him to part from such a girl without an attempt at
least to intensify this effect. He drew her towards
the window, apart from the others, to watch, as he
said, for the coming of the slow old fly from
Redborough which was to convey him away.</p>

<p>"My sister is coming," he said, "and I hope you
will be friends. I will instruct her to bring in my
name on every possible occasion, that you may not
altogether forget me."</p>

<p>"There is no likelihood that we shall forget you;
we see so few people here."</p>

<p>"And you call that a consolatory reason! I shall
see thousands of people, but I shall not forget <i>you</i>."
It was Roland's way to use no name. He said <i>you</i>
as if there was nobody but yourself who owned that
pronoun, with an inference that in thinking of the
woman before him, whoever she might be, he, in his
heart, identified her from all women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Hester was embarrassed by his eyes and his tone,
but not displeased. He had pleased her from the
first. There is a soft and genial interest excited in
the breasts of women by such a man, at which
everybody smiles and which few acknowledge, yet
which is not the less dangerous for that. It rouses
a prepossession in his favour, whatever may come of
it afterwards; and he had done his best to fill up all
his spare moments, when he was not doing something
else, in Hester's company. It would be vain
to say that this homage had not been sweet, and it
had been entertaining, which is so great a matter. It
had opened out a new world to her, and expanded
all her horizon. With his going all these new
outlets into life would be closed again. She felt a
certain terror of the place without Roland. He had
imported into the air an excitement, an expectation.
The prospect of seeing him was a prospect full of
novelty and interest, and even when he did not
come, there had always been that expectation to
brighten the dimness. Now there could be no expectation,
not even a disappointment; and Hester's
eyes were large, and had a clearness of emotion in
them. She might have cried&mdash;indeed, it seemed
very likely that she had cried at the thought of his
going away, and would cry again.</p>

<p>"Though I don't know," he added, leaning against
the recess of the window, and so shutting her in
where she stood looking out, "why I should leave so
many thoughts here, for I don't suppose they will do
me any good. They tell me that your mind will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
too fully, and, alas, too pleasantly occupied. Yes, I
say alas! and alas again! I am not glad you will
be so pleasantly occupied. I had rather you were
dull a little, that you might have time now and then
to remember me."</p>

<p>"You are talking a great deal of nonsense, Mr.
Ashton&mdash;but that is your way. And how am I to
be so pleasantly occupied? I am glad to hear it,
but I certainly did not know. What is going to
happen?"</p>

<p>"Is this hypocrisy, or is it kindness to spare me?
Or is it&mdash;&mdash;? They tell me that I ought to&mdash;congratulate
you," said Roland with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Congratulate me? On what? I suppose," said
Hester, growing red, "there is only one thing upon
which girls are congratulated: and that does not
exist in my case."</p>

<p>"May I believe you?" he said, putting his hands
together with a supplicating gesture, "may I put
faith in you? But it seemed on such good authority.
Your cousin Edward&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did Edward tell you so?" Hester grew so red
that the flush scorched her. She was angry and
mortified and excited. Her interest changed, in a
moment, from the faint interest which she had felt
in the handsome young deceiver before her, to a
feeling more strong and deeply rooted, half made
out of repulsion, half bitter, half injured, yet more
powerful in attraction than any other sentiment of
her mind. Roland was ill-pleased that he was
superseded by this other feeling. It was a sensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
quite unusual to him, and he did not like it. "He
had no right to say so," said Hester; "he knew
it was not true."</p>

<p>"All is fair in love and war," said Roland;
"perhaps he wished it to be&mdash;not true."</p>

<p>"I do not know what he wishes, and I do not
care!" Hester cried, after a pause, with a passion
which did not carry out her words. "He has never
been a friend to me," she said hastily. "He might
have helped me, he might have been kind&mdash;not that
I want his help or any one's," cried the girl, her
passion growing as she went on. Then she came to
a dead stop, and gave Roland a rapid look, to see
how much he had divined of her real feelings.
"But he need not have said what was not true,"
she added in a subdued tone.</p>

<p>"I forgive him," said Roland, "because it is not
true. If it had been true it would not have been
so easy to forgive. I am coming back again, and I
should have seen you&mdash;changed. It was too much.
Now I can look forward with unmingled pleasure.
It is one's first duty, don't you think, to minister to
the pleasure of one's grandparents? they are old;
one ought to come often, as often as duty will
permit."</p>

<p>Hester looked up to him with a little surprise, the
transition was so sudden; and, to tell the truth, the
tumult in her own mind was not so entirely subdued
that she could bestow her full attention upon
Roland's <i>double entendre</i>.</p>

<p>He laughed. "One would think, by your look,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
that you did not share my fine sense of duty," he
said; "but you must not frown upon it. I am
coming soon, very soon, again. A fortnight ago the
place was only a name to me; but now it is a name
that I shall remember for ever," he added with
fervour.</p>

<p>Hester looked at him this time with a smile upon
her mouth. She had recovered herself and come
back to the diversion of his presence, the amusement
and novelty he had brought. A half sense of
the exaggeration and sentimental nonsense of his
speech was in her smile; and he was more or less
conscious of it too. When their eyes met they
both laughed; and yet she was not displeased,
nor he untouched by some reality of feeling. The
exaggeration was humorous, and the sentiment not
altogether untrue.</p>

<p>"Do you say that always when you leave a
place?" Hester said.</p>

<p>"Very often," he acknowledged; and they both
laughed again, which, to her at least, was very
welcome, as she had been doubly on the verge of
tears&mdash;for anger and for regret. "But seldom as I
do now," he added, "you may believe me. The old
people are better and kinder than I had dreamt of;
it does one good to be near them; and then I have
helped myself on in the world by this visit, but that
you will not care for. And then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Roland broke off abruptly, and gazed, as his
fashion was, as feeling the impotence of words to
convey all that the heart would say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>It was very shortly after this that the white horse
which drew the old fly from Redborough&mdash;the horse
which was supposed to have been chosen for this
quality, that it could be seen a long way off to
console the souls of those who felt it could never
arrive in time&mdash;was seen upon the road, and the last
moment had visibly come. Not the less for the
commotion and tumult or other feelings through
which her heart had gone, did Hester acknowledge
the emotions which belonged to this leave-taking.
The depth and sadness of Roland's eyes&mdash;those
expressive eyes which said so many things, the
pathos of his mouth, the lingering clasp in which
he held her hand, all affected her. There was a
magic about him which the girl did not resist,
though she was conscious of the other side of it,
the faint mixture of the fictitious which did not
impair its charm. She stood and watched him
from the low window of the parlour which looked
that way, while the fly was being laden, with a
blank countenance. She felt the corners of her
mouth droop, her eyes widen, her face grow longer.
It was as if all the novelty, the variety, the pleasure
of life were going away. It was a dull afternoon,
which was at once congenial as suiting the circumstances
and oppressive as enhancing the gloom.
She watched the portmanteau put in as if she had
been watching a funeral. When Roland stepped in
after his grandfather, who in the softness of the
moment had offered, to the great surprise of everybody,
to accompany him to the station, Hester still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
looked on with melancholy gravity. She was almost
on a level with them where she stood looking out;
her mother all smiles, kissing her hand beside her.
"I wish you would show a little interest, Hester,"
Mrs. John said. "You might at least wave your
hand. If it were only for the old captain's sake
whom you always profess to be so fond of." Roland
at this moment leant out of the window of the fly
and took off his hat to her for the last time. Mrs.
John thought it was barbarous to take no notice.
She redoubled her own friendly salutations; but
Hester stood like a statue, forcing a faint ghost of a
smile, but not moving a finger. She stood thus
watching them long after they had driven away, till
they had almost disappeared in the smoke of Redborough.
She saw the fly stop at the Grange and
Miss Catherine come out to the door to take leave of
him: and then the slow vehicle disappeared altogether.
The sky seemed to lean down almost
touching the ground; the stagnant afternoon air
had not a breath to move it. Hester said to herself
that nothing more would happen now. She knew
the afternoon atmosphere, the approach of tea, the
scent of it in the air, the less ethereal bread-and-butter,
and then the long dull evening. It seemed
endless to look forward, as if it never would be
night. And Mrs. John, as soon as the fly was out of
sight, had drawn her chair towards the fire and
begun to talk. "I am sure I am very sorry he has
gone," Mrs. John said. "I did not think I should
have liked him at first, but I declare I like him very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
much now. How long is it since he came, Hester?
Only a fortnight! I should have said three weeks
at least. I think it was quite unnatural of the
captain to talk of him as he did, for I am sure he
is a very nice young man. Where are you going?
not I hope for one of your long walks: for the night
closes in very early now, and it will soon be time
for tea."</p>

<p>"Don't you think, mamma," said Hester, somewhat
hypocritically, "that it would be kind to go
in and keep Mrs. Morgan company a little, as she
will be quite alone?"</p>

<p>"That is always your way as soon as I show any
inclination for a little talk," said her mother provoked,
not without reason. Then she softened, being
at heart the most good-natured of women. "Perhaps
you are right," she said, "the old lady will be lonely.
Give her my love, and say I should have come to see
her myself, but that&mdash;" Mrs. John paused for a
reason, "but that I am afraid for my neuralgia," she
added triumphantly. "You know how bad it was
the other day."</p>

<p>Thus sanctioned Hester threw her grey "cloud"
round her, and ran round to console Mrs. Morgan,
while her mother arranged herself comfortably with
a footstool, a book upon the table beside her, and
her knitting, but with a furtive inclination towards
an afternoon nap, which the greyness of the day,
the early failing light in the dark wainscoted parlour,
and the absence of all movement about her, naturally
inclined her to. Mrs. John was at the age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
when we are very much ashamed of the afternoon
nap, and she was well provided with semblances of
occupation in case any one should come. But Mrs.
Morgan was far beyond any such simple deceit.
Eighty has vast advantages in this way. When she
felt disposed to doze a little she was quite pleased,
almost proud of the achievement. She had indeed
a book on the table with her spectacles carefully
folded into it, but she did not require any occupation.</p>

<p>"I had a kind of feeling that you would come,
my pet," she said as Hester appeared. "When I
want you very much I think some kind little angel
must go and tap you on the shoulder, for you always
come."</p>

<p>"The captain would say it is a brain-wave," said
Hester.</p>

<p>"The captain says a great deal of nonsense, my
dear," said the old lady with a smile, "but think of
him going with Roland to the station! He has been
vanquished, quite vanquished&mdash;which is a great
pleasure to me. And Emma is coming. I hope she
will not wear out the good impression&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is she not so&mdash;nice?" Hester asked.</p>

<p>The old lady looked her favourite intently in the
face. She saw the too great clearness of Hester's
eyes, and that her mouth was not smiling, but drawn
downward; and a vague dread filled her mind. She
was full of love and charity, but she was full of
insight too; and though she loved Roland, she did
not think it would be to the advantage of Hester
to love him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Roland is very nice," she said. "Poor boy, perhaps
that is his temptation. It is his nature to
please whomsoever he comes across. It is a beautiful
kind of nature; but I am not sure that it is not
very dangerous both for himself&mdash;and others."</p>

<p>It was fortunate that Hester did not divine what
her friend meant.</p>

<p>"Dangerous&mdash;to please?" she said, with a little
curiosity. She liked Roland so much, that even
from the lips of those who had more right to him
than she had, she did not like to hear blame.</p>

<p>"To wish to please&mdash;everybody," said the old
lady. "My poor lad! that is his temptation. Your
grandfather, if he were here&mdash;my dear, I beg your
pardon. I have got into the way of saying it: as
if my old man was your grandfather too."</p>

<p>"I like it," Hester said, with the only gleam of
her usual frank and radiant smile which Mrs.
Morgan had yet seen. But this made the old lady
only more afraid.</p>

<p>"There is nobody he could be more fatherly to,"
she said. "What I meant was that if he were here,
he would have something ready out of a book, as you
and he are always going on with your poetries; but
I never was a poetry woman, as you know. Life is
all my learning. And I have seen people that have
had plenty of heart, Hester, if they had given it
fair play&mdash;but frittered it away on one and another,
trying to give a piece to each, making each believe
that she (for it is mostly upon women that the spell
works) was the one above all others. But you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
so young, my darling; you will not know what I
mean."</p>

<p>A faint, uneasy colour, came on Hester's face.</p>

<p>"I think I know what you mean," she said. "I
understand how you should think so of Mr. Ashton.
You don't see so well as you did, dear Mrs. Morgan,
when you have not got your spectacles on. If you
did, you would see that when he talks like <i>that</i>, he
is ready to laugh all the time."</p>

<p>"Is that so, my love? Then I am very glad to
hear you say so," cried the old lady. But she knew
very well that her supposed want of sight was a
delusion, and that Hester knew it was only for
reading that she ever used her spectacles. She
felt, however, all the more that her warning had
been taken, and that it was unnecessary to proceed
further. "You are young and sweet," she said, "my
dear: but the best thing still is that you have
sense. Oh, what it is to have sense! it is the best
blessing in life."</p>

<p>Hester made no reply to this praise. Her heart
was beating more quickly than usual. What she
had said was quite true: but all the time, though
he had been ready to laugh, and though she had
been ready to laugh, she was aware that there was
something more. The tone of banter had not been
all. The sense of something humorous, under those
high-flown phrases, had not exhausted them. She
was intended to laugh, indeed, if they did not secure
another sentiment; but the first aim, and perhaps
the last aim, of the insidious Roland, had been to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
secure this other sentiment. Hester did not enter
into these distinctions, but she felt them; and when
she thus put forward Mrs. Morgan's failing sight, it
was with a natural casuistry which she knew would
be partially seen through, and yet would have its
effect. This made her feel that there was no reply
to be made to the praise of her "sense," which the
old lady had given. Was it her cunning that the
old lady meant to praise? There was a little
silence, and the subject of Roland was put aside,
not perhaps quite to the satisfaction of either; but
there was nothing more that could be said.</p>

<p>And presently the old captain came back, groaning
a little over his long walk.</p>

<p>"Why do you never remind me," he said, "what
an old fool I am? To drive in that jingling affair,
and to walk back&mdash;two miles if it is a yard&mdash;well,
then, a mile and a half. My dear, what was half a
mile when you and I were young is two miles now,
and not an inch less; but I have seen him off the
premises. And now, Hester, we shall have our
talks again, and our walks again, without any
interruption&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not speak so fast, Rowley. There is Emma
coming; and Hester will like a girl to talk with,
and to walk with, better than an old fellow like
you."</p>

<p>"That old woman insults me," said the captain.
"She thinks I am as old as she is&mdash;but Hester, you
and I know better. You are looking anxious, my
child. Do you think we are a frivolous old pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
talking as we ought not&mdash;two old fools upon the
brink of the grave?"</p>

<p>"Captain Morgan! I, to have such a thought!
And what should I do without you?" cried Hester,
in quick alarm. This brought the big tears to
her eyes, and perhaps she was glad, for various
causes, to have a perfectly honest and comprehensible
cause in the midst of her agitation, for those
tears.</p>

<p>"This was brought to my mind very clearly to-day,"
said the old captain. "When I saw that young
fellow go off, a man in full career of his life, and
thought of his parents swept away, the mother whom
you know I loved, Mary, as dearly as a man ever
loves his child, and the father whom I hated, both
so much younger than we are, and both gone for
years; and here are we still living, as if we had
been forgotten somehow. We just go on in our
usual, from day to day, and it seems quite natural;
but when you think of all of them&mdash;gone&mdash;and we
two still here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are not forgotten," said the old lady, in her
easy chair, smiling upon him, folding those old
hands which were now laid up from labour, hands
that had worked hard in their day. "We have
some purpose to serve yet, or we would not be
here."</p>

<p>"I suppose so&mdash;I suppose so," said the old man,
with a sigh; and then he struck his stick upon the
floor, and cried out, "but not, God forbid it, as the
instruments of evil to the house that has sheltered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
us, Mary! My heart misgives me. I would like
at least, before anything comes of it, that we should
be out of the way, you and I."</p>

<p>"You were always a man of little faith," his wife
said. "Why should you go out of your way to
meet the evil, that by God's good grace will never
come? It will never come; we have not been
preserved for that. You would as soon teach me
Job's lesson as to believe that, my old man."</p>

<p>"What was Job's lesson? It was, 'Though
He slay me, yet will I trust in Him,'" Captain
Morgan said.</p>

<p>"Oh, my Rowley!" cried the old lady, "I was
wrong to say you were of little faith! It is you that
are the faithful one, and not me. I am just nothing
beside you, as I have always been."</p>

<p>The old captain took his wife's old hands in his,
and gave her a kiss upon her faded cheek, and they
smiled upon each other, the two who had been one
for nearly sixty years. Meanwhile, Hester sitting by,
looked on with large eyes of wonder and almost
affright. She did not know what it meant. She
could not divine what it could be that made them
differ, yet made them agree. What harm could they
do to the house that sheltered them, two old, good,
peaceful people, who were kind to everybody? She
gazed at them with her wondering young eyes, and
did what she could to fathom the mystery: then
retired from it, thinking it perhaps some little fad of
the old people, which she had no knowledge of, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
means of understanding. The best people, Hester
thought, when they grew old take strange notions
into their heads, and trouble themselves about
nothing; and of course they missed Roland. She
broke in upon them in that moment of feeling, as
soon as she dared speak for wonder, making an effort
to amuse them, and bring them back to their usual
ways; and that effort was not in vain.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<h3>DANCING TEAS.</h3>


<p>It was shortly after the departure of Roland that
a new era dawned for Hester in social life. Mrs.
Algernon Merridew had felt from the moment of her
return from Abroad that there was a work for her to
do in Redborough. It was not the same as in her
maiden days, when she had been at the head of
Harry's household, wonderfully enfranchised indeed,
but still somewhat under the awe of Aunt Catherine.
But now she was altogether independent, and nobody
had any right to make suggestions as to who she
should invite or how she should entertain, to a
married lady, with an admiring husband, not to speak
of brother&mdash;and sisters-in-law, eagerly anticipating
social elevation by her means, at her back. Ellen
was not ill-natured. She was very willing to promote
the happiness and prosperity of others, so long as she
could do so without any diminution of her own&mdash;a
negative goodness which the world at large is very
well pleased to acknowledge as satisfactory. And it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
is not at all probable that the representations of
Harry, or the good-humoured suggestions of Algernon
inspired by Harry, to the effect that it would be
sublimely good of her to take up and brighten the
life of Hester, would have come to very much, had it
not at the same time occurred to Ellen that Hester
was the best assistant she could have on her own side
of the house, in the indispensable work of making
her Thursdays "go." Rather than that they should
not "go," she would have embraced her worst enemy,
had she possessed one; and she did not care to rely
upon the Merridew girls, feeling as she did that she
had condescended in entering their family, and that
they must never be allowed to forget that they owed
everything to her, and she nothing to them. But at
the same time she required a feminine auxiliary, a
somebody to be her right hand, and help to make
everything "go." The result of her cogitations on
this subject was that she set out for the Vernonry
one afternoon in the little victoria, which Algernon,
rather tremulous about the cost, had set up for her,
and which, with the smart coachman who for the
moment condescended to be gardener too, and the
boy on the box who was of quite a fashionable size,
looked a very imposing little equipage. Ellen lay
back in her little carriage enveloped in her new sealskin,
with a little hat of the same upon her head, and
a muff also of the same, and her light hair looking
all the brighter against that dark background, with
bracelets enough to make a jingle wherever she went,
and which she had to push up upon her arm from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
time to time, and a violet scent about herself and all
her garments, at least the scent which is called violet
at Piesse and Lubin's, which served her purpose.
When she drove up in this state, it may be supposed
what a flutter she made in the afternoon atmosphere.
The inmates of the Vernonry rushed to their windows.</p>

<p>"It is that little doll Ellen, come to show off more
of her finery," said one sister.</p>

<p>"I wonder why she comes here, when you set her
down so, Matilda," said the other.</p>

<p>They kept behind the curtains, one over the other's
shoulder, that she might not see how curious they
were. But when Ellen floated in at the verandah
door, and was evidently gone to see Mrs. John, their
astonishment was boundless. They shrugged their
shoulders and interchanged glances with Mr. Mildmay
Vernon, who, with his newspaper in his hand,
had appeared at his window.</p>

<p>"Did he think she was going to see <i>him</i>?" Miss
Matilda said, even while addressing these satires in pantomime
to him. "What interest can he take in Ellen?
It is just prying and curiosity, and nothing more."</p>

<p>The gentleman's comments were not more friendly.
He chuckled as he saw where Ellen was going.</p>

<p>"The old cats will think it a visit to them, and
they will be disappointed," he said to himself, all the
same shrugging his shoulders back again to Miss
Matilda. They kept on the watch all the time the
visit lasted, and it was a long one. The sisters
discussed the victoria, the horse, the little footman,
the great fur rug which Ellen threw off as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
jumped lightly out of the carriage. It was somewhat
hard indeed that a little minx like Ellen should have
all these things, and her seniors, her betters, who
would have enjoyed them so much, none of them.
But so it always is in this unjust world.</p>

<p>On the other side of the partition from where the
sisters were sitting, Ellen's appearance had caused an
almost equal sensation. She was not looked for, and
the proposal she made was a very startling one.</p>

<p>"I am going to begin my <i>Th&eacute;s Dansantes</i>, and I
want you to help me," she said abruptly. "I want
you to be my right hand; just like my sister. You
know I can't do everything myself. Mrs. John, you
shall come too, I never intended to leave you out;
but I want Hester to help me, for she is the only
one that can help me. She is really my cousin.
Clara and Connie are only my sisters-in-law, and I
don't care to have them about me in that position.
It would be nice for me, and it would be giving
Hester the best of chances. Now, Mrs. John, I am
sure you will see it in that light. What could be
better for a girl? All that she will meet will be the
best sort of people: and she would have her chance."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by having my
chance&mdash;and I don't want any chance," said Hester,
in a flush of shame and indignation; but Ellen put
her down with a wave of her gloved hand and arm,
all tinkling with bangles.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't know anything about it,"
she said, "an unmarried girl! We don't want you to
know. Your mother and I will talk about that; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
you can understand that a nice dance in a nice house
like ours will be something pleasant. And you
would be there not just like a visitor, but like one of
the family, and get a good deal of attention, and as
many partners as ever you liked."</p>

<p>"Of course, Ellen, of course," cried Mrs. John. "I
am sure <i>I</i> understand you. It would be very nice
for Hester. At her age every girl likes a little
gaiety, and in my position I have never been able to
give it to her. It was very different when my husband
was alive, when we were in the White House.
I am sure I have never grudged it to you, but it
made a great difference. I was not brought up to
this sort of thing. I had my balls, and my parties,
as many as could be wished, when I was Hester's age.
If her poor papa had lived, and we had stayed in the
White House, she would have held a very different
position. It gives me a little prick, you will understand,
to think of Hester wanting anybody to be kind
to her; but still, as it is so, and as you are her
relation, I never could object. You will find no
objection from me."</p>

<p>"No, I should think not," cried Ellen, throwing
back her warm coat. It was at the time when sealskins
were rare, when they were just "coming in,"
and Mrs. John looked at it with admiration. She
did not ask, as the Miss Vernon-Ridgways did, why
this little minx should have everything; but she
remembered with a little regret the days when she
too had everything that a young woman could desire,
and wondered, with a little flutter at her heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
whether when Hester married she would have a
sealskin and a victoria, and all the other crowns of
happiness. She looked with something of a pathetic
look at her daughter. Ah! if she could but see
Hester as Ellen was!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hester was elevating her young head as
was natural, in special scorn of the "chance" which
her cousin meant to secure for her, and in defiance
altogether of the scheme, which nevertheless (for she
was but human and nineteen, and the prospect of a
dance every week took away her breath) moved her
in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"When I was a child," Hester said, "when you
first came to see us, Cousin Ellen, you said you must
see a great deal of me, that I must go to your
house, that you and Harry would take me out,
that I should have a share in your pleasures.
Perhaps my mother and you don't remember&mdash;but
I do. How I used to look out for you every morning;
how I used to watch at the window, thinking
they will surely come or send, or take some notice
to-day. I was very young, you know, and believed
everything, and wished so much to drive about and
to go to parties. But you never came."</p>

<p>"To think she should remember all that!" cried
Ellen, a little abashed. "Of course I didn't. Why,
you were only a child. One said so to please you;
but how can you suppose one meant anything?
What could I have done with you then&mdash;a little
thing among lots of people? Why, you wouldn't
have been allowed to come! It would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
bad for you. You would have heard things you
oughtn't to hear. You wouldn't have let her come,
would you, Mrs. John?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, my dear," said Mrs. John, promptly.
To tell the truth, it was she who had complained
the most though it was Hester who had been most
indignant. She forgot this, however, in the new
interest of the moment. "It would never have
done," she said, with all sincerity. "Your cousin,
of course, only spoke to please you, Hester. I never
could have permitted you, a little thing at your
lessons, to plunge into pleasure at that age."</p>

<p>"Then why&mdash;" cried Hester, open-mouthed; but
when she had got so far she paused. What was the
use of saying any more? She looked at them both
with her large brown eyes, full of light and wonder,
and a little indignation and a little scorn, then
stopped and laughed, and changed the subject.
"When I go to Cousin Catherine's," she said,
"which I never do when I can help it, we stand in
a corner all the evening, my mother and I. We
are thankful when any one speaks to us&mdash;the
curate's daughters and the Miss Reynoldses and
we&mdash;&mdash; There is never anybody to take us in to
supper. All the Redborough people sweep past
while mamma stands waiting; and then perhaps
some gentleman who has been down once before
takes pity, and says, 'Haven't you been down to
supper, Mrs. Vernon? Dear me! then let me take
you.' You will please to remember that my mother
is Mrs. Vernon, Ellen, and not Mrs. John."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"I only say it for&mdash;short," said Ellen, apologetically;
"and how can I help what happens at Aunt
Catherine's? I don't go in for her ways. I don't
mean to do as she does. Why do you talk of Aunt
Catherine to me?"</p>

<p>"It is only to let you see that I will not be treated
so," the girl said with indignation. "If you think I
will go to your house like that, just because you are
a relation, I won't, Ellen; and you had better understand
this before we begin."</p>

<p>"What a spitfire it is!" said Ellen, raising her
hand with a toss of all her bracelets to brush
Hester's downy cheek with a playful touch. "To
think she should put all these things down in her
book against us! I should never remember if it
were me. I should be furious for the moment, and
then I should forget all about it. Now, Hester,
you look here. I am not asking you for your own
pleasure, you silly; I am asking you to help <i>me</i>.
Don't you see that makes all the difference? You
are no good to Aunt Catherine. She doesn't need
you. She asks you only for civility. But it stands
to reason, you know, that I can't look after all the
people myself if I am to have any of the fun. I
must have some one to help me. Of course you will
have every attention paid you; for, don't you see, you
are wanted. I can't get on without you. Oh, <i>of
course</i>, that makes all the difference! I am sure
your mamma understands very well, even if you are
too young and too silly to understand!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Hester, your cousin is quite right," said Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
John, eagerly. The poor lady was so anxious to
secure her child's assent to what she felt would be
so manifestly for her advantage that she was ready
to back up everything that Ellen said. A spark of
animation and new life had lighted up in Mrs. John's
eyes. It was not a very elevated kind of hope perhaps,
yet no hope that is centred in the successes of
another is altogether ignoble. She wanted to see
her child happy; she wanted Hester to have her
chance, as Ellen said. That she should be seen
and admired and made much of, was, Mrs. John
felt, the first object in her life. It would not be
without some cost to herself, but she did not shrink
from the idea of the lonely evenings she would have
to spend, or the separation that might ensue. Her
mind, which was not a great mind, jumped forward
into an instant calculation of how the evening dresses
could be got, at what sacrifice of ease or comfort.
She did not shrink from this, whatever it might be.
Neither did she let any visionary pride stand in her
way as Hester did. She was ready to forgive, to
forget, to condone all offences&mdash;and in the long discussion
and argument that followed, Mrs. John was
almost more eloquent than Ellen on the mutual
advantages of the contract. She saw them all the
instant they were set before her. She was quite
tremulous with interest and expectation. She ran
over with approval and beaming admiration as Ellen
unfolded her plans. "Oh, yes, I can quite understand;
you want to strike out something original,"
cried Mrs. John. "You must not think I agree with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Hester about Catherine's parties. I think Catherine's
parties are very nice; and relations, you
know, must expect to give way to strangers,
especially when there are not enough of gentlemen;
but it will be much pleasanter for you to
strike out something original. I should have liked
it when I was in your circumstances, but I don't
think I had the energy. And I am sure if Hester
can be of any use&mdash;&mdash; Oh, my darling! of course
you will like it very much. You always are ready
to help, and you have plenty of energy&mdash;far more
than I ever had&mdash;and so fond of dancing too; and
there are so few dances in Redborough. Oh, yes,
I think it is a capital plan, Ellen! and Hester will
be delighted to help you. It will be such an opening
for her," Mrs. John said, with tears of pleasure
in her eyes.</p>

<p>Hester did not say much while the talk ran on.
She was understood to fall into the scheme, and
that was all that was necessary. But when Ellen,
after a prolonged visit and a detailed explanation to
Mrs. John, which she received with the greatest
excitement and interest, of all her arrangements as
to the music, the suppers, and every other particular
they could think of between them, rose to take her
leave, she put her hand within Hester's arm, and
drew her aside for a few confidential words.</p>

<p>"Don't think of coming to the door," she said to
Mrs. John; "it is so cold you must not stir. Hester
will see me out. There is one thing I must say to
you, dear," she added, raising herself to Hester's ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
when they were out of the mother's hearing, "and
you are not to take it amiss. It must be a condition
beforehand&mdash;now please, Hester, mind, and
don't be offended. You must promise me that you
will have nothing to say to either of the boys."</p>

<p>The quick flush of offence sprang to Hester's
face.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean. You mean
something you have no right to say, Ellen!"</p>

<p>"I have a very good right to say it&mdash;for I'm a
married lady, and you are only a girl, and of course
I must know best. You are not to have anything
to say to the boys. Any one else you like. I am
sure I don't mind, but will do anything I can to
help&mdash;but not the boys. Oh, I know something
about Harry. I know you have had the sense
to&mdash;&mdash; Well, I don't understand how far it went,
but I suppose it must have gone as far as it could
go, for he's not clever enough to be put off with
anything less than a real No. But you may have
changed your mind, or a hundred things might
happen. And then there's Edward; Aunt Catherine
would be wild if anything got up between you and
Edward. Oh, I think it's always best to speak plain,
and then one has nothing to reproach one's self with
after. She would just be <i>wild</i>, you know. She
thinks there is nobody good enough for him; and
you and she have never got on. Oh, I don't suppose
there's anything between you and Edward. I never
said so; the only thing is you must promise me to
have nothing to say to <i>them</i>. There are plenty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
others&mdash;much better matches, and more eligible:
and it's always a pity to have anything to say to a
cousin in that way. You're sure to set the family by
the ears; and then it narrows the connection, and
you keep always the same name; and there are
ever so many drawbacks. So just you promise me,
Hester, there's a dear&mdash;never," said Ellen, seizing
her with both hands, and giving her a sudden perfumy
kiss, "never!" and the salute was repeated
on the other cheek, "to have <i>anything</i> to say to the
boys&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The boys! if you think I care anything for the
boys! I shall have nothing to say to anybody," cried
Hester, with indignation, drawing herself out of this
too urgent embrace. Ellen tossed back all her
bracelets, and shook her golden locks and her sealskin
hat, and made an agitation in the air of scent
and sound and movement.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's being a great deal too good," she
cried.</p>

<p>Hester stood at the door, and looked on while Mrs.
Algernon got into her victoria and drew the fur rug
over her, and was driven away, waving the hand and
the bracelets in a parting jingle. The girl was not
envious, but half-contemptuous, feeling herself in
her poverty as much superior to this butterfly in
furs and feathers, as pride could desire. Hester did
little credit to the social gifts, or the popularity or
reputed cleverness in her own way, of her gay
cousin who had been the inspiration of Harry, and
now was the guide of Algernon Merridew. She said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
to herself with the downrightness of youth, that
Ellen was a little fool. But her own cheeks were
blazing with this parting dart which had been thrown
at her. The boys! She had a softened feeling of
amity towards Harry, who had done all a stupid
young man could do to overcome the sentence of
disapproval under which Hester was aware she lay.
It had been embarrassing and uncomfortable, and
had made her anything but grateful at the moment;
but now she began to feel that Harry had indeed
behaved like a man, and done all that a man could
to remedy her false position, and give her a substantial
foundation for the native indomitable pride which
none of them could crush, though they did their
best. No; she would have nothing to say to Harry.
She shook her head to herself, and laughed at the
thought, all in the silence of the verandah, where
she stood hazily gazing out through the dim greenish
glass at Ellen, long after Ellen had disappeared.
But Edward! that was a different matter altogether.
She would give no word so far as he was concerned.
Edward was altogether different from Harry. He
piqued and excited her curiosity; he kept her mind
in a tremor of interest. She could not cease thinking
of him when she was in his neighbourhood, wondering
what he would do, what he would say. And if it
did make Catherine <i>wild</i>, as Ellen said, that was but
an inducement the more in Hester's indignant soul.
She had no wish to please Catherine Vernon. There
had not been any love lost between them from the
first, and Hester was glad to think she was not one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of those who had in any way pretended to her kinswoman's
favour. She had never sought Catherine,
never bowed the knee before her. When she went to
the Grange it had been against her will, as a matter
of obedience to her mother, not to Catherine. If it
made Catherine wild to think that there was a friendship,
or any other sentiment between Edward and the
girl whom she had so slighted, then let Catherine be
wild. That was no motive to restrain Hester's freedom
of action. All this passed through her mind as she
stood in the verandah in the cold, gazing after Ellen,
long after Ellen was out of sight. There were many
things which gave her a sort of attraction of repulsion
to Edward. He had tried to deceive Roland
Ashton about her, telling him she was about to
marry Harry, when he knew very well she had
refused to marry Harry. Why had he done it?
And in his manner to herself Edward was two men.
When they were alone he was more than friendly;
he was tender, insinuating, anxious for her approval,
eager to unfold himself to her. But when he saw
her in the Grange drawing-room he never went near
her. In early times she had asked why, and he had
answered with deceiving words, asking how she
thought he could bear to approach her with commonplace
civilities when she was the only creature in the
place for whom he cared at all, a speech which had
pleased Hester at first as something high-flown and
splendid, but which had not preserved its effect as
time went on: for she could not see why he should
not be civil, and show some regard for her presence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
even if he could not devote himself to her. And
why could he not devote himself to her? Because
it would displease Catherine. When Catherine was
not present, there was nobody for him but Hester.
When Catherine was there, he was unconscious of
her existence. This, of course, should have shown
clearly to Hester that he was not worthy of her
regard, and to some degree did so. But the conviction
was mingled with so lively a curiosity in
respect to him, so strong an opposition as regarded
her, that Hester's moral judgment was confused
altogether. She was anxious, eager to overcome her
adversary, excited to know what Edward's meaning
was. He would not stand up for her like a true
friend, but at the same time he would never let her
alone, he would still let her see that she was in his
mind. She disliked him, yet&mdash;&mdash; She almost loved
him, but still&mdash;&mdash; Nothing could be more tantalising,
more entirely unlike indifference. To think of
meeting Edward in society, yet not under Catherine's
eye, made her heart beat loudly. She had never
done this hitherto. She had met him by chance on
the Common or in the country roads about, and his
voice had been almost that of a lover. She had met
him before the world, and he had scarcely seemed to
know her. But how could these meetings test what
he meant? This it was that made Ellen's proposal
exciting, even while she herself half scorned it.
Harry? no! Poor Harry! she would not disturb
his peace, nor say a word, nor even look a look
which should put him in jeopardy. But Edward?&mdash;ah!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
that was a different matter. It was with all
the vehemence of a quarrel that she snatched at the
chance put into her hands, even when she had
seemed to scorn it. To know what he meant&mdash;to
know what was his real state of mind. If he would
be afraid of what the world would say, as well as of
what Catherine would say&mdash;in that case there was
no scorn which Hester did not feel herself capable
of pouring out upon her unworthy admirer; but if
things proved different? Ah! then she did not
know what softening, what yielding, she might not
be capable of. The very thought melted her heart.</p>

<p>And yet she had thought herself more "interested"
(this was what she called it) in Roland Ashton than
in any man whom she had ever heard of before.
The world had seemed all blank to her when he
went away. His step at the door had made her
heart thrill: the commonplace day had brightened
up into something smiling and sweet when he came
in. But then she had not been fighting a duel with
him half her life as she had been doing with Edward.
She was not curious, <i>intrigu&eacute;e</i>, to know what Roland
meant. She thought (with a blush) that she did
know&mdash;more or less&mdash;what he meant. But Edward
was a sort of sphinx; he was an enemy to be beaten,
a riddle to be read. She said to herself, what would
please her best would be to force him into self-abandonment,
to carry him so out of himself that he
should give up all pretences and own himself at her
disposal, and then to turn her back upon him and
scorn him. Would she have done so? she thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
she would, and that in this lay the secret of her
interest in Edward and his crooked ways. And now,
here was the trial approaching. She would see what
was his true mettle, she would be able indeed to
judge of him now.</p>

<p>"Hester," said Mrs. John appearing at the open
door, "what do you mean by lingering in the cold, to
get your death? You will be chilled to your very
bones. You have not even a shawl on, and in this
cold place. What are you doing? I have called you
three times, and you never paid any attention. Even
to stand here for five minutes freezes me."</p>

<p>"Then don't stand here, mamma," said Hester,
taking hold of her mother's arm and thus leading
her back in the old way. They did not walk about
very much together now. Hester preferred her own
thoughts to her mother's society, and Mrs. John was
not sorry to be left quietly by herself at the fireside.
How long it seemed since the time when she held
her mother's arm clasped in hers whenever she
moved, and used it as a helm to guide that timid
and trustful woman wherever she would! A little
compunction came over her as she made use of that
well-known expedient again, and steered her mother
(all the more gently for that thought) back to her
own chair.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, dear, this is very comfortable," said
Mrs. John, "but I wish you had come at once, when
I called you, for we must not lose any time in
thinking about your dresses. You must do Ellen
credit, that is one thing clear. I can't have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
dowdy, Hester. The Merridew girls shall not have a
word to say about the Vernons on your account. Oh,
I know they will if they can; they will whisper and
say how proud we all are, and give ourselves airs,
and just look at Hester in a washed muslin! I
would rather go without my dinner," said Mrs. John
with vehemence, "for a whole year."</p>

<p>"But I shall not let you do that, mamma."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hester, just hold your tongue. What do
you know about it? I would rather sell my Indian
shawl, or my pearls&mdash;Dear me, what a good thing I
did not part with my pearls! that is something
nobody can turn up their noses at. And you can say
you got them from your mother, and your grandmother
before her&mdash;which is more than they ever
had. But there are the dresses to be thought of,"
said the tender mother, looking in Hester's face, half
awed, half appealing: for even in the pride of
descent she was forced to remember that you cannot
send your child to a <i>Th&eacute; Dansante</i> with nothing but
a string of pearls round her neck, however fine, and
however long in the family it may have been.</p>

<p>"Dresses! one will do," said Hester, with a little
flush of pleasure, yet determination to repress her
mother's unnecessary liberality. "You forget what
you are talking of, mother dear. One dress is as
much as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And to whom do you suppose you are speaking,"
said Mrs. John with dignity; "there are a great
many things which you think you know better than
I. Perhaps you are wrong there too; but I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
going to bandy words with you. One thing I must
say, than when we talk of ball dresses I know a great
deal better than you. Oh, but I do&mdash;I had to get
everything for myself in old days. Your father
delighted in seeing me fine, but he never pretended
to have any taste. All the responsibility was on me.
Considering that we are poor, and that you are so
young, I should think tulle would do: or even
tarlatan. Hester, I should like you to have silk
slips, that gives a character to a thing at once. A
white one, a pink one, and a blue one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear mamma, a white frock, that is all I want.
I am sure that is all I want; we can't afford any
more. And as for silk slips&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hold your tongue, Hester, what do you know
about it?" cried Mrs. John, exasperated. "You
have never been at a ball in your life. You can't
know what's wanted, like me. There are quantities
of other things besides. Shoes&mdash;you must have satin
shoes and silk stockings, and gloves, and something
to wear in your hair. I don't even know what's
worn now. We used to have wreaths in my day,
but perhaps that's not the fashion at present. When
I had not a maid&mdash;and of course, poor child, you
have no maid&mdash;I used to have a hair-dresser to do
my hair when I was going out. We wore it quite
high on the top of our heads, and now you wear it
down in the nape of your neck. What a thing
fashion is! We had gigot sleeves all puffed out with
feather cushions, and I used to wear a lace scarf
which was very becoming. We had muslins in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
time, nice clear book-muslins, and when you had
worn it two or three times for balls you just wore it
out in the evenings at home. Tarlatan is not half
so profitable," said Mrs. John, with a very serious
face, "but you must have it, I suppose, all the
same."</p>

<p>"Mother," said Hester, when her mother paused
for breath, "I feel quite horrified at all this. Why
should I dress up so fine for Ellen's parties? I shall
only be a sort of poor relation. My washed muslin
will do very well. Nobody will expect anything
better from me."</p>

<p>"Then that is just why you shall have something
better," said the poor lady, her pale countenance
brightening with a pretty pink flush. "You sha'n't
go at all if you can't go as my daughter should.
You shall have a white first, and then a&mdash;no, not a
pink; pink used to be my colour, for you know I
was pale, and my hair was plain brown, not like
yours. Yours is a little too&mdash;auburn&mdash;for pink.
You must have a blue for your second, with silk
slips made very simply, and tarlatan over that.
White shoes, and white gloves, and my pearls. Oh,
how glad I am I kept my pearls! It will be such a
pleasure, dear, to see you dressed, it will be like old
times again. And you must ask Ellen what to wear
in your hair, a wreath, or just one flower at the side,
with a spray hanging down over your neck. Mr.
Ashton, I am sure, would get it for me in town. For
flowers and those sort of things one should always
send to London. And you must have a fan. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
wonder if my ivory fan would be old-fashioned? I
must ask Ellen. And, dear child, don't stand there
doing nothing when there is not a moment to lose,
but ring for the tea. We must have tea first. I
always feel better after, and then we must put everything
down upon paper, and calculate what it will
cost, and how we are to do."</p>

<p>"I don't want all that," said Hester again: but
the sound of it flattered her youthful ears; for she
was only a girl, when all was said.</p>

<p>"Don't talk any nonsense, child, but ring for the
tea," said Mrs. John, feeling herself for once mistress
of the occasion. "But Hester," she added, in so
solemn a tone that Hester came back half frightened
to hear what it was, "if you ever have children, as
I hope you will, be sure you have one of your girls
taught how to cut out, and to look after the dressmaking.
If we only could have them made at
home, what a saving it would be!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<h3>THE FIRST OF THEM.</h3>


<p>Young Mrs. Merridew's <i>Th&eacute;s Dansantes</i> made a
great commotion in Redborough. Dancing teas&mdash;what
did it mean? It meant some nonsense or
another. You might be sure it meant nonsense of
some kind, as it was Ellen Vernon that was at the
bottom of it, the elder people said; but the younger
ones were of a different opinion. It did not matter
to them so much that Ellen Vernon was silly; indeed
the greater part of them were so dazzled by the
furs and the bracelets, and the victoria, if not by
the brilliant fairness and beaming smiles and prettiness
of the bride, that they did not remember Ellen
Vernon had been silly, and thought Mrs. Algernon
Merridew not only the leader of fashion, but the
most amiable and good-natured of all queens of
society, the most "easy to get on with" and most
full of "go." Nothing like her and her dresses,
and her house and her company, had ever been seen
in the quiet, steady-going country town. She made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
it known graciously, that she was always at home at
lunch, and there was scarcely a day that a merry
party did not assemble at her house, filling the
newly-furnished pretty room with chatter and
laughter, and all the distracting devices of careless
youth to get rid of a few of its golden hours. And
already there had been half a dozen dinners, far too
soon and quite unnecessary, as all the elders said.
She ought to have waited until everybody had given
her and her husband a dinner before she began to
return their hospitalities. But Ellen had no idea
either of waiting or returning the heavy dinners to
which she, as a daughter of one of the reigning
houses of the town, and her husband as belonging,
if not to that rank, at least to the foremost respectability,
were invited by all the principal people.
The entertainments she gave were reckless young
dinners, where there was no solemnity at all, and
perhaps not much wit, but where laughter abounded
and all sorts of wild schemes of pleasure were invented.
And just as the solid people who had made a
point of having a dinner for the Algernon Merridews
began to feel a little offended at the goings-on of the
young household which paid no attention to ordinary
rules of civility, the younger portion of the population
was thrown into the wildest excitement by
the announcement of the <i>Th&eacute;s Dansantes</i>, and
frowning mothers were courted to smiles again, by
the anticipated pleasure of their children. The old
Merridews, the father and mother, looked on with
pride but misgiving, the brothers and sisters with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
pride and delight, as they felt themselves already
rising high upon the topmost wave of society by
means of their brilliant sister-in-law.</p>

<p>"Only mind what you are about and keep hold
on the reins, my boy," old Merridew said to his son,
which Algernon promised with a laughing "Trust
me for that."</p>

<p>"Trust Algy, indeed!" his mother said, shaking
her head. "I would not trust him a step further
that I saw him with that crazy little thing by the
side of him; all my hope is that being a Vernon her
people will step in." They were all sure that no
great harm could happen to a Vernon in Redborough.
Harry, her brother, was always at her side, as faithful
as her husband, backing her up. And Catherine
herself could not disapprove, for she went to the
house now and then, and laughed when she was
spoken to on the subject. "Ellen was always like
that," she said, "wild for pleasure and amusement.
She has asked me to her dancing teas, as an entertainment
quite suited to my years and habits." All
which things reassured the Merridews and the other
anxious persons about.</p>

<p>"And you are going to this dancing tea?" Catherine
Vernon said.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Edward, indifferently. "They
would think it strange if I did not go. And they
expect you&mdash;Merridew told me so. He said it would
add such dignity to their little party!"</p>

<p>There was something in the tone with which
Edward said this which Catherine did not like. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
was true that she herself had always represented the
invitation as ludicrous, yet it was quite true that her
presence would have added dignity to the party,
and there was nothing ridiculous in the idea that
Algernon Merridew thought so. This annoyed her
a little, but it was the annoyance of a moment.
She said, "I hope you will enjoy yourself," with a
laugh, which Edward on his side found as offensive:
but he did not betray this, and smiled in reply, as
he knew she meant him to smile, with a sort of
apologetic indulgent air.</p>

<p>"I shall do the best I can," he said, and they both
laughed. She tenderly, thinking how good he was
to take this trouble in order to gratify the frivolous
young pair and keep up the Vernon traditions; he
with a fierce question to herself, why shouldn't he
enjoy it? at least it would be an evening to himself,
with nobody to keep watch over him and make a
note of every girl he danced with. Alas for Catherine!
if she noticed the girls he danced with it was in
order to invite them afterwards (if she approved of
them), for she had no jealous desire to keep him to
herself, but wanted him to marry. But then there was
one at least whom she could never have tolerated.
And the chief point in Edward's anticipations, as in
Hester's, was the freedom of intercourse permitted
under Ellen's easy young wing, and the opportunity
he would have of seeing how the eager, large-eyed
girl would look among other girls, when he could
approach her freely. This gave him something of
the same sense of curiosity which was so warm in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Hester's mind. How would she look among other
girls&mdash;how would she receive him? It did not occur
to him as probable that she would resent that avoidance
of her when under Catherine's eye which he
had so often assured her made him wretched. He
felt that the little secret between them, the stolen
glance he would give her at the Grange parties, the
little shrug with which he pointed her attention to
his bondage, would have an attraction even greater
than had he been always at her side; and in some
sense this was true. But he did not think of Hester's
judgment and of the natural indignation of her high
spirit; neither did he think of the comparison she
made between him and Harry, who had never
hesitated to show his devotion. To compare himself
and Harry, seemed to Edward impossible. A big
idiot&mdash;a nonentity. She had more sense than that.</p>

<p>Never was there such a spectacle seen in Redborough
as the first of the <i>Th&eacute;s Dansantes</i>. The
Merridews' house was near the White House, and
consequently on a little eminence, which answered
all the purposes of a great eminence in that flat
country. It stood in the midst of a little shrubbery
above which it rose on white steps, to make the position
still more commanding. There was a long domed
conservatory at one side, the windows were all plate
glass, and when you consider that within and without
the place was lighted up&mdash;like the Crystal
Palace, people said&mdash;you may imagine something of
the imposing effect. The conservatory was all hung
with Chinese lanterns, and was fairy land to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
young guests inexperienced in such glorious effects;
the two drawing-rooms were both thrown open
for dancing. There were very few chaperons; only
here and there a middle-aged mother, too devoted
to her charge, yawned behind her fan with nobody
to speak to, not a lady of her own age to exchange
experiences with, no elderly gallant to get her a cup
of tea. All was youth, rampant, insolent, careless&mdash;feeling
that the world was made for it, and rejoicing
to shake itself free of every trammel. Mrs. Ellen
set them the example in the most daring way.</p>

<p>"What do we want with the old things here?" she
said; "they would much rather be in bed, and the
best place for them. I don't suppose you mean to do
anything wrong, any of you girls, and if you did they
wouldn't stop you. If you can't take care of yourselves,
if you want a chaperon, there's me. And
there's Fanny Willoughby, and Lilian Melville, and
Maud Seton; they've all been married as long as I
have. Where could you find steadier married women?
and ain't we enough to chaperon a couple of dozen
girls? I never pretend to ask old people, unless it
was just to let them see how everything looks, poor
old things, once in a way."</p>

<p>This being the creed of the mistress of the feast,
it is not to be supposed that her disciples were more
catholic. And there was no limit to the fun which
the young people promised themselves. To do them
justice, it was very innocent fun. The greatest sin
on the conscience of the wildest romp in the place
was that of having danced ten times with a favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
partner, besides sitting out all the square dances (of
which there were only two) in his company. Algernon
himself had insisted upon two. He said it was
respectable: and he danced both with the least
popular of the young ladies, that they might not feel
themselves slighted, for he was a very good fellow.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such a muff?" his wife said,
who never condescended to the Lancers. "I do
believe he likes to hop about with the ugliest thing
he can pick up. I thought I had kept out all the
ugly girls, but I haven't succeeded. If there is one,
Algy is sure to find her out."</p>

<p>"To show you that you have no need to be jealous,"
some one said.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>jealous</i>!" cried Ellen, with supreme disdain.</p>

<p>The young Merridews, brothers and sisters, thought
her the most wonderful creature that had ever been
born. Her light hair was in curls and frizzes (newly
come in and extremely captivating) all over her
head. Her dress was a sort of purple, a colour nobody
but herself ventured to wear, but which threw
up her fairness with the most brilliant effect. She
had all her jewellery on, from the diamonds Harry
had spent all his available money (under her own
directions) in buying for her, to the little bracelet
contributed by the clerks at the bank. Her arm was
covered nearly up to the elbow, and the sound she
made when they fell over her hands and she had to
push them back again was wonderful. It was like a
whole concert of fairy music, the bangles representing
the higher notes, the big golden manacles furnishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
a bass. She liked to hold up her hands and shake
them back with a pretty cry of "Tiresome! Why
is one forced to wear all this upon one?" Ellen said.</p>

<p>And Mrs. John had accomplished her wish. She had
got, if not three, at least two new dresses for Hester,
one upon her shoulders at this moment, the other,
the blue one, laid up all ready in the box. White of
course was the first. It had the silk slip upon which
Mrs. John had set her heart, which was so much
more thrifty than anything else, which could be
covered over again and again, as she pointed out to
her daughter, and which at the present moment was
veiled in floods and billows of tarlatan. Tarlatan
was the fashion of those days: anything that was
limp, that took&mdash;as people now love to say, "nice
folds," being considered utterly dowdy. And when
Hester appeared in those crisp puffings, with her
pearls round her throat, and white flowers in the
hair which her mother called auburn, even young
Mrs. Merridew herself held her breath. She turned
her cousin round and round to examine her.</p>

<p>"Well, I call that a <i>beautiful</i> dress," she said.
"Who put it into your head to get a dress like that?
Why, it is the height of the fashion! Those <i>bouillon&eacute;es</i>
are just the right thing to wear. And do you
mean to say these are real pearls? Oh, go away, or
I shall kill you! Why have I not pearls? They
are far more <i>distingu&eacute;s</i>&mdash;oh, far more!&mdash;than my
paltry bits of diamonds. Oh, take her away, or I shall
not be able to keep my hands off her. And such
flowers! they must have come from Forster's. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
certain they came from Forster's. Mine are French,
but they are not so pretty," Ellen said.</p>

<p>Hester stood and smiled while these comments
were made, though with a half sense of shame. She
thought it annoyed her very much to be subjected to
such a survey, and so no doubt it would have done
had not the result been so satisfactory; but it is hard
to be really displeased by approbation.</p>

<p>As for Ellen, she whispered behind her hand to
Harry, "The old lady must have a great deal more
than we think for. She must have been saving up.
You don't get a dress like that for nothing."</p>

<p>"It's not the dress&mdash;she always looks nice, whatever
she puts on," said faithful Harry.</p>

<p>His sister contemplated him with eyes full of contempt.
"What is the use of talking to such a silly?"
she said. "Not the dress! She never looked one
ten-thousandth part so well all her life, and that you
know just as well as me."</p>

<p>No, she had never looked so well all her nineteen
years. Her dress was simple indeed, but it was
perfect in all its details, for Mrs. John had remembered
everything. The flowers were artificial, which also
was the fashion then, but they were from Forster's,
procured by Roland Ashton and brought down by his
sister Emma, who had arrived that same afternoon.
The pearls were beautiful, more beautiful than any
other ornament in the room. Hester stood beside
her cousin to receive the guests with a sense that
there were no imperfections about her. In the days
of the washed muslin there was always a fear that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
flounces were not quite even, the bows were not quite
firmly sewed on, or something else which at any
moment might come to pieces and betray the homemadeness
of the garment. But she stood up in her
virgin robes with a sense of delightful security&mdash;a
knowledge that all was complete, which was exhilarating
to her spirits. She was not the one white
swan in this little provincial party: there were faces
quite as lovely as Hester's, which, as a matter of
fact, was not so perfect as her dress; but there was
no one to whom the anticipated pleasure was so
entirely ideal. Her mind did not come down to
practical delights at all. She was going to be happy&mdash;was
she going to be happy? How does it feel to
be happy? These were the questions in her mind.
She had been so, she was aware, as children are,
without knowing it; but this would be conscious,
whatever it was.</p>

<p>The dancing began. It was a very pretty scene,
and Hester, not in herself perhaps so overwhelmingly
gay as the others about her, was caught upon that
stream of careless youth and carried with it in spite of
herself. An atmosphere of pleasure was about her;
eyes looked upon her admiring, almost caressing,
every glance was pleasant; the rougher part of the
world had disappeared altogether. It was as if there
was nothing but merry dancers, laughing engagements,
an interchange of enjoyment, all about. Happy!
Well, she could not say that this was not happiness.
It might be so, for anything she could tell. There
was not much that was ideal about it, but yet&mdash;.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Just as she was thinking this, she felt in a moment of
repose her hand suddenly taken, drawn into some one
else's hand: and, looking round suddenly, saw Edward
close to her, looking at her with a subdued glow in
his eyes, a look of admiration and wonder. It was
quite a steady, straightforward gaze&mdash;not furtive, not
flying. She started at the touch and look, and
attempted to draw away her hand, but it was held
fast. But he had not lifted her hand, he had taken
it where it hung half-veiled by her furbelows, and
he had turned his back towards the company
isolating her in a corner, while he inspected her.
He drew a long breath apparently of satisfaction
and pleasure.</p>

<p>"I am late," he said, "but this was worth waiting
for. Cinderella, where have you left your pumpkin
coach?"</p>

<p>Hester's brow grew dark, her heart seemed to swoon
away in her bosom altogether, then came to itself
again with a rush of heat and indignation. She
wrenched her hand out of that hold, a flood of colour
came to her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean to insult me," she said; "but
this is not a place to insult me&mdash;I am among friends
here."</p>

<p>"Why do you say so, Hester? Insult you! What
an ungenerous thing to say! as if I was in the habit
of doing so, and must not here because you have
friends. What a cruel thing to say!"</p>

<p>"Would you rather have it in your power to insult
me always?" said Hester. Her lip began to quiver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
a little. What an odious thing it is to be a woman,
to be always ready, when you would rather not, when
you want to show yourself most strong and angry, to
cry! She clenched her hands tightly to keep herself
down. "I am no cinder-wench, Mr. Edward Vernon,"
she said. "I have given you no reason to call me so.
It is a pitiful thing for a man to notice a girl's dress.
If I am dressed poorly, I am not ashamed of it. It is
not a sin to be poor."</p>

<p>"Hester! a girl of your sense to be so foolish!
How could I mean that? What I meant was, that
you have come out glorious, like the moon from the
clouds. Nothing could be sweeter than that little
house-frock you used to wear out on the Common. I
liked it better than all the finery. But to-night you
are like a young princess. Why did I say Cinderella?
Heaven knows; just because I was dazzled and
bewildered, and because you are a princess; and the
pleasure of seeing you made my head go round. Have
I made my peace? Well then, there's a darling, turn
round and let me see you, that I may see all the
finery, and everything that makes you so lovely, in
detail."</p>

<p>"You may have made it a little better," said Hester;
"but why do you go on talking like that? I am
neither lovely nor a darling; and you shall not say so&mdash;you!
that would not see me if this, instead of being
Ellen's house, were the Grange."</p>

<p>"You have me at your mercy there," said
Edward. "I confess you have me at your mercy,
there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon which Hester melted a little, and, perceiving
the abashed look which he had put on, began to
falter, and presently found herself guilty of the
commonplace expedient of asking if he did not think
it a pretty scene.</p>

<p>"Oh, very pretty," said Edward; "that is to say, I
don't know anything about it. I looked for one
individual when I came in, and as, as soon as I
found her, she began to bully me violently, I feel a
little muddled, and I don't know what to think. Give
me a little time."</p>

<p>By this time, as was natural, Hester began to
think herself a monster of folly and unkindness, and
to feel that she was ready to sink through the floor
with shame.</p>

<p>"I did not mean to be cross," she said. "I thought&mdash;that
is, I had been looking&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here she stopped, feeling herself get deeper and
deeper into difficulty. Her countenance changed
from the girlish freshness of complexion, which
everybody admired, into a burning red; her eyelids
unable to keep up, her heart beating as if it would
burst through silk slip, and tarlatan <i>bouillon&eacute;e</i>, and
all&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, let us have this dance. I like the music,"
said Edward, drawing her hand suddenly through his
arm.</p>

<p>"But I am engaged."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind, if you are engaged. You were
engaged to me before ever you came," he said, lightly,
and drew her into the whirl. Hester was at the age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
(in society), when, to throw over a partner, looks like
the guiltiest treachery. She could not take any
pleasure in the dance, for thought of it.</p>

<p>"I must go and ask his pardon. I am sure I am
very sorry. I did not intend to be so false; and there
he is, poor man, not dancing."</p>

<p>These words Hester said breathless over the
shoulder of the enterprising intruder, who had carried
her off under the victim's eyes.</p>

<p>"Poor man!" Edward echoed, with a laugh. "I
am glad he has nobody to dance with. What right
had he to engage you? and you regret him; and you
don't want me."</p>

<p>Here Hester rebuked her cousin.</p>

<p>"You have no right to say so. I might want&mdash;I
mean I might like very well to dance with you when
you condescended to ask me; but not to be run away
with, without a word, and made to do a false thing.
False things are what I hate."</p>

<p>"You say that with such meaning. You must be
thinking of more than a dance. Am I one of the false
things you hate?"</p>

<p>"I do not hate you," said Hester, as they came to
a pause, looking doubtfully into his face; "but I do
not think you are very true."</p>

<p>"You mean I don't blurt out everything I mean,
and am capable now and then of keeping something
to myself. I can keep my own counsel&mdash;not like
that fellow there," Edward permitted himself to say:
which was a mistake; for Hester looked up and saw
the gaze of honest Harry dwelling upon her with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
regret, and much tenderness, and was touched at once
with sympathy and indignation.</p>

<p>"If you mean Harry, no one could ever doubt <i>him</i>,"
said Hester, in the warmth of her compunction. "If
he is your friend, he is always your friend. He is not
afraid of what any one says."</p>

<p>"Ah, Hester, you are always harping on that
string," said Edward. "I know what you mean;
but can't you understand the position I am in, and
understand <i>me</i>? Don't you know I am in bondage?
I cannot say my soul is my own. I dare not think
nor feel but as I am told. If I were to follow my
own heart without disguise, I think it would be my
ruin. We will not name any names, but you know.
And I know what you think about that big stupid
there, but you are mistaken. It is not that his heart is
more true. It is that he has not brains enough to see
what is liked and what is not liked. He is not even
sympathetic enough. He does what he likes, and
never considers if it is good for him or not."</p>

<p>"Sympathetic!" cried Hester. "He is sympathetic
with me. When he sees me lonely and neglected he
comes and stands beside me. If he cannot do more,
he does do that. I don't pretend to say that he is
very amusing," she continued, with a laugh, "but he
does what he can. He stands by me. Oh! failing
other things that are better, I like that. Rather than
being sympathetic with Catherine, I like him to
sympathise with me."</p>

<p>"There is no question of names," said Edward,
"We must not get personal. But I am glad you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
find Harry amusing. I never heard that he was so
before. He is standing by Ellen now; that's what
he's here for. They will come to grief, these young
people. They are beginning a great deal too fast.
You know young Merridew, or old Merridew either,
can never keep up this. Ellen ought to know better.
But Harry will have scope for this great accomplishment
that you appreciate so highly. He will have to
stand by his sister."</p>

<p>"And he will," Hester said.</p>

<p>She scarcely thought of the dancing, so much did
this conversation&mdash;so unlike a conversation to be
carried on in the whirl of a waltz&mdash;occupy her. It
occurred to her now, as breath failed her, to remember
how in all the accounts of a first ball she had
ever read, the heroine had felt all other sentiments
melt away in the rapturous pleasure of dancing with
the man of her heart. Novels were all Hester's
experience. She remembered this, and it gave her a
half comic, half miserable sensation to realise that she
was not thinking about the dancing at all. She was
carrying on her duel with Edward. There was
always a warm sense of gratification in that&mdash;a stirring
up of all her faculties. She liked to go on
carrying it a step further, defying and puzzling him,
and wondering on his side how much he meant, how
much that he left to be inferred, was true. The
heroine in a novel is generally the point of everybody's
admiration in the ball-room, and to look at
the perfection of the waltz which she and her lover
enjoy so deeply, the whole assemblage stands still.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
But nothing of this kind occurred in Hester's case.
As she had so little experience, the chances are that
she was by no means the best dancer in the room,
and certainly Edward was not the other best. Their
waltz was the means of carrying on the discussion
which to both was the most attractive possibility.
When she realised this, Hester was a little amused,
but likewise a good deal disappointed. She felt
a disagreeable limit thus placed to her power to
enjoy.</p>

<p>"Come into the conservatory," Edward said.
"Don't you think you have had enough? Oh, it
is your first ball. I suppose you like it; but I am
beginning to lose my relish for those sort of affairs."</p>

<p>"You are not so old that you should give up
dancing, Cousin Edward."</p>

<p>"Old! No, I hope I am not old yet, and I don't
intend to give up dancing; but I like to walk here
better&mdash;with you. I like to talk better&mdash;with you.
I like to see your face, Hester, and see how it
changes from kindness to wrath, from friendship to
indignation, from a patient sense that I am endurable,
to a violent consciousness&mdash;&mdash; Come and sit
here."</p>

<p>"You seem to think I never do anything but
think of you: and that is the greatest mistake,"
Hester said.</p>

<p>Upon which he laughed. The place he had led
her to was only partially lighted. There were many
other groups scattered about among the plants and
stands of flowers. Flirtation was openly recognised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
in this youthful house as one of the portions of the
evening's entertainment, and large provision made
for it. There was nobody to notice with whom it
was that Edward was amusing himself, and he felt
fully disposed to take advantage of his opportunities.
He laughed at Hester's indignant disclosures. "If
you did not think a little about me, dear, you would
not notice so distinctly my course of conduct in other
places, you could not be sure that it was much more
agreeable to me, instead of standing by your side
and trying to be as amusing as Harry, to lead down
Mrs. Houseman and old Lady Kearney to supper
or to tea."</p>

<p>"My mother should go out of the room before
either of them," cried Hester. "Do you know who
she is? Sir John Westwood is her cousin: a duke's
daughter once married into her family&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I quite understand you and agree with you,
Hester. It is nothing that she is a perfect little
gentlewoman, and has far better manners than any
of us; but because she is a cousin to a heavy
baronet, who is not good enough to tie her
shoe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Edward!" The girl was so startled she could
not believe her ears.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know very well what I am saying. You
don't know me, that is all. You think I am a
natural snob, when I am only a snob by circumstances.
You yourself, Hester, do you really think
your mother should stand upon her cousin and upon
Lady Ethelinda (or whatever was her name), her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
great-grandmother, and not upon herself far better
than either? I can't imagine you think that."</p>

<p>Hester was surprised and silenced for the moment.
She had been so often reminded of the noble grandmother
and the baronet cousin, and so hard put to
it to find a ground of superiority on which her pride
could take refuge, that this sudden appeal to her
better judgment bewildered her. She was startled
to find those advantages which were indisputable,
and to which everybody deferred in theory, so
boldly under-valued; but yet the manner of doing it
made her heart beat with pleasure. Yes; people
thought her dear little mother silly, and Hester was
aware that she was not clever. Sometimes, in the
depths of her own soul, she had chafed, as children
will, at the poor lady's dulness and slowness of
comprehension; but she <i>was</i> a perfect little gentlewoman.
And he saw it! He felt in his heart that
she was above them all&mdash;not because of Lady
Ethelinda (she was Lady Sarah in reality) and Sir
John, but herself.</p>

<p>"I did not know you were a Radical," she said.
She knew nothing about Radicals, though instinctively
in her heart she agreed with them. "I
thought you cared for family and that sort of
thing."</p>

<p>"Do you?"</p>

<p>Hester paused. She flung higher her young head,
which was proud with life and a sense of power
unknown. "I should like to be a king's daughter,"
she said, "or a great soldier's or a great statesman's.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
I should like my name to mean something. I should
like people to say, when they hear it, that is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you don't care much about Sir John?&mdash;that
is what I thought. I am no Radical; I am all for
decorum and established order and church and state.
How could you doubt that? But, by the way, there
is a person whom neither of us like, who certainly
has the kind of rank you prize. Don't you know
who I mean, Hester? When a stranger comes to
Redborough, there is one name he is sure to hear.
If she were a duchess she could not be better
known. To be her relation carries a certain weight.
We were always a leading family in the place, I
suppose. But why are we, for instance, so much
better than the Merridews and all the rest of the
respectable people? She has something to do with
it, I can't deny, though I don't like her any more
than you."</p>

<p>"Edward," cried Hester breathlessly, "about that
we ought to understand each other. I have no
reason to like Catherine. Yes, I will say her name;
why shouldn't I? She has not liked me. I was
only a child, and if I was saucy she might have
forgiven me, all these years. But she has taken the
trouble on the contrary to humiliate me, to make
me feel that I am nobody, which was unworthy. But
you: she has been kind to you. She has been more
than kind&mdash;she has loved you. I have seen it in
her eyes. She thinks that nobody is worth thinking
of in comparison with you. If&mdash;if&mdash;who shall I
say?&mdash;if Sir Walter Scott came here, or Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Tennyson, she would rather have you. And yet,
you that ought to be so grateful, that ought to love
her back, that ought to be proud&mdash;oh, I should if
I were you. If she were fond of me I should be
proud. I hate all those wretched people who take
from her hand, and then sneer and snarl at her, like
dogs&mdash;no, not like dogs: dogs are far nobler&mdash;like
cats; that is better."</p>

<p>Hester's eyes were shining with eloquence and
ardour; the little movement of her head so proud,
so animated, so full of visionary passion, threw back
and gave a certain freedom to the hair which her
mother called auburn. Her whole figure was full
of that force and meaning which is above beauty.
Edward looked at her with smiling admiration. If
his conscience was touched, or his temper at least,
he did not show it.</p>

<p>"Do you call me a cat?" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not in fun. I am as earnest as ever
I can be. It is wicked, it is miserable, and I cannot
understand you. All the others are as nothing in
comparison with you."</p>

<p>He grew a little pale under this accusation; he
would not meet it directly. "But you know," he
said, "why she hates you. It is for your mother's
sake."</p>

<p>"My mother!" cried Hester astonished. "But
no one could hate my mother." The suggestion
took away her breath.</p>

<p>"It is true, all the same. I thought you did not
know. She was to have married John Vernon, your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
father, and he preferred&mdash;&mdash;that is the whole account
of it; then he got into trouble, and she had her
revenge."</p>

<p>"Did she ruin my father?" said Hester in a low
whisper of horror.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't know if it went so far as that," Edward
said.</p>

<p>A hesitation was in his speech. It was scarcely
compunction, but doubt, lest a statement of this
kind, so easily to be contradicted, might be injudicious
on his part&mdash;but then, who would speak to
Hester on such a subject? And her mother was a
little fool, and, most likely, did not know, or would
be sure to mistake, the circumstances.</p>

<p>"Don't let us talk of that: it is so long past,"
he said; "and here is a wretch, a scoundrel, coming
up with his eye fixed upon you as if he was a
partner. How I loathe all your partners, Hester!
Mind, the rest of the dances are for me. I shall
watch for you as soon as you have shaken that
fellow off."</p>

<p>But Hester did not care for the dances that
followed. She went through them indifferently,
faithful to the partners who had presented themselves
before he came on the scene; and, indeed, the
conversation in the conservatory had not drawn
her nearer to Edward. It had given her a great
deal to think of. She had not time in the whirl
and fluster of this gaiety to think it all out.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<h3>A NEW COMPETITOR.</h3>


<p>Emma Ashton had brought Hester's flowers, and
though she was tired with her journey, had taken
a great deal of interest in Hester's dress. When
she came in to show herself to the old people in her
white robes before her ball, the stranger had surveyed
her with much attention. She had kissed her slowly
and deliberately when introduced to her.</p>

<p>"Roland told me a great deal about you," she
said. "I suppose we are cousins too. You look
very nice. I hope you will enjoy yourself." She
was a very deliberate, measured talker, doing everything
steadily. When Hester was gone, she resumed
her seat beside her grandmother.</p>

<p>"Roland admires her very much. She is pretty,
but I should think she had a great deal of temper,"
Emma said.</p>

<p>"Temper is scarcely the word. She is a great
favourite with your grandfather&mdash;and with me too&mdash;with
me too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Roland told me," said Emma. "When I say
temper I don't mean any harm. She would do
much better for Roland if she had a good deal of
temper. That is what he wants to keep him
straight; for a man ought not to flirt after he is
married, and he will, unless she keeps him in
order."</p>

<p>"Married! but is he likely to marry? I did not
hear anything of it."</p>

<p>"When a man can keep a sister he can keep a
wife," said Emma, announcing this fact as if it were
an oracle. "He has a house, and everything that is
necessary. And of course I shall not stand in his
way. I can go back to Elinor, where I am a sort of
head nurse, and cheap enough at the money; or I
can be a governess. That touches his pride&mdash;he
does not like that."</p>

<p>Here the old captain came back, who had been
putting his favourite carefully into the fly.</p>

<p>"Why has she not her mother with her?" he
said. "I like a girl to have her mother with her.
It is pretty, it is natural. I do not like those
new-fashioned, independent ways."</p>

<p>"But they are much more convenient, grandpapa,"
said Emma. "Think how I should have been situated
had a girl always wanted her mother with her.
Elinor, with her family, cannot always be going out;
and when she goes she likes to amuse herself, she
does not go for me. A girl going out with her
mother means a devoted sort of old lady like the
mothers in books. Such nonsense, you know&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
a girl's mother, when she is eighteen or so, is rarely
more than forty, and people of forty like amusement
just as much as we do. It is better, on the whole, I
think, when every one is for herself."</p>

<p>"Well, that is not my opinion," said the old
captain, shortly.</p>

<p>He was accustomed to do most of the talking
himself, and it startled him to have it thus taken
out of his hand.</p>

<p>"I suppose an invitation will come for me," said
Emma calmly, "as soon as they know I am here;
and then Hester and I can go together. Roland said
there was no dancing, but I think it always safest to
bring a ball-dress. It is not heavy, though it takes
up a good deal of room; but then you can always
take one box into the carriage, and the railway
only charges by weight."</p>

<p>"Roland is very busy, I suppose, my dear. You
only see him in the evening?"</p>

<p>"I don't always see him in the evening. He has
his own friends, and I am getting a few acquaintances
too. If he gives me my living and very little
to do I ought to be grateful to him, but I would
not let him give up his own amusements for me.
That wouldn't be fair. Oh yes, he is very busy.
He has found so many new people to do business
for down here."</p>

<p>"I hope to goodness he won't speculate with
their money and ruin them," Captain Morgan
said.</p>

<p>"Ruin! oh, I hope not. But Roland says there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
is nothing so exciting as to be on the verge of
ruin. He says it is better than a play: for instead
of looking on at the acting, the acting is going on
inside of you. But it is his trade to speculate,
isn't it, grandpapa? That is what he is there for,
and he is very good at it they say. I suppose
this girl has not any money? When they are
pretty and nice they seldom have."</p>

<p>"What girl?" said Captain Morgan, almost
haughtily&mdash;as haughtily and harshly as the old
gentleman could persuade himself to speak.</p>

<p>"Doesn't he know, grandmamma?" said Emma,
"the girl Roland admired so much: and she would
just do for him, if she had some money: but so
nice looking as he is, and so well established in
business, I don't think, unless there is money, he
should throw himself away."</p>

<p>"Is it Hester Vernon that you mean?" asked
the captain in an angry voice.</p>

<p>"She does not mean any harm, Rowley. Don't
you see Hester is just to her an abstract person,
not the dear girl she is to you and me. And
Emma," said the old lady almost with timidity,
"I fear your ball-dress will not be of much use.
Mrs. Merridew will not think of inviting you&mdash;she
will not perhaps know you are here."</p>

<p>"Roland met her, grandmamma," said Emma
calmly. "He told me; we are all cousins, I
believe. She will be sure to invite me, or if not,
you will be able to get me an invitation. People
always exert themselves to get invitations for girls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
It is like helping young men on in business. We
cannot go and make acquaintances for ourselves
as young men go and set up offices, but we must
have our chance, you know, as well. Of course,"
said Emma in her deliberate way, "it is for everybody's
advantage that we should have our chance
as well as the men."</p>

<p>"And what do you call your chance?" said
Captain Morgan. He planted himself in the front
of the fireplace with his legs very wide apart, which,
as his wife well understood, meant war.</p>

<p>"My old man," she said, "what do you know
about the talk of girls? They have one way of
thinking, and we have another. They are young,
and we are old."</p>

<p>"Hester is younger than she is," said the captain,
"let her alone. She is as ready to talk as there is
any need to be."</p>

<p>"My chance, grandpapa?" said Emma with a
slow little laugh. "It is not necessary, is it, to
explain? a girl's chance is in making&mdash;friends. If
one goes for a governess one's family does not like
it. They would rather you were your sister's head
nurse with all the trouble, and without any pay.
Roland has taken me now&mdash;and I do not require to
work for my living; but it is not so very cheerful
with Roland that I should not wish&mdash;if I could&mdash;to
make a change. We must all think of ourselves
you know."</p>

<p>"My dear," said the old lady in her soft voice,
"in one way that is very true."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is very true, I think, in every way. It
might be cheerful for me if Roland were to spend
his evenings at home as Tom Pinch in Dickens did
with his sister. But then Roland is not a bit like
Tom Pinch, and I said to him when I came, 'You
are not to change your life for me.' So that sometimes,
you know, I am in the house all alone all
day, and then if he is out to dinner, or if he has
any evening engagement, I am alone all the night.
And if he were to marry, why there would be an
end of me altogether. So you see, grandmamma,
wherever I am, it is very natural that I should
wish to have my chance."</p>

<p>"How old are you?" said the captain abruptly.</p>

<p>"I shall be twenty-three at Christmas," said
Emma, raising her eyes to his face. She was
curious to know why he asked&mdash;whether he
thought her older, or younger than her age,
whether he thought it was strange she should
still be unmarried. "I was kept very much out
of sight when I was with Elinor," she said half
apologetically. She had not had her "chance" as
she had always wished to have. She had not been
very well treated she felt in this life, the youngest
of seven. She had been passed on from one to
another of her married sisters to make herself
useful. All of them had said that Emma must
"come out," but no one had taken any trouble
about it. She had to scramble for a dress, a very
cheap one, and to coax Elinor into taking her to
some little local merrymaking, and so opening, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
it were, the gates of society. As soon as she could
say that she was "out" Emma had kept the idea
of having "her chance" of making friends and
getting invitations always before her. But her
opportunities had not been great, and Elinor had
not devoted herself to her younger sister. She
was still young enough to amuse herself, and it had
not occurred to her to put so unimportant a person
as Emma in the foreground. So that she had
never been allowed to have much of a "chance."
Emma had not much experience of the world.
Of the many novels she had read, and which
were her guides to life, a great many devoted
themselves to the history and description of young
ladies at whose entrance into a ball-room every
man present fell metaphorically on his knees.
She was acquainted with many evening parties in
fiction at which the fate of countless young men
and women was decided. The smallest dance
would be represented there as bringing people
together who were never more to be sundered.
Emma herself had not produced any such sensation
at the small parties she had hitherto gone to, but
she felt that this glory must be awaiting her,
and especially that in a new place like this Redborough,
in some waltz or other, among some
unknown assembly she should meet her fate.</p>

<p>This being the case, it is not to be wondered at
that she should lose no time in announcing her certainty
of an invitation to anything so likely to
conduce to such an object as Ellen Merridew's dancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
teas. She had come down to Redborough prepared
to be cousin to all the world. Roland, indeed, had
taken pains to explain that Catherine Vernon's
cousins were not actually <i>her</i> cousins, but she had
thought it better in many ways to ignore this, and
to descend upon the new scene with the most amiable
disposition to embrace as a near relative every Vernon
presented to her. Among them all, what could be
more likely than that her fate should be found? She
meant no harm to anybody. It would be doing no
harm, certainly, if any young man fell in love with
her, to make him happy by marrying him. She felt
most strongly the supreme necessity of marrying for
her own part. She had no disguise with herself on
this subject, and with her grandparents she did not
think it necessary to have any disguise. Everything
was involved in it. Roland had taken the responsibility
of her upon himself and given her a home,
with very little to do, and enough to make her sufficiently
comfortable. Emma had always been brought
up to consider everything from a strictly practical
point of view. She had been taught to believe that
she had no right to anything, that it was out of their
bounty and charity that her brothers and sisters, now
one, now another, afforded her a temporary home.
And she was very comfortable with Roland&mdash;but if
he were to marry, what then? The comfort of having
a home of her own, a husband of her own with a
settled income, was to Emma in prospect the crown
of all good things. She would not have been ashamed
to say so if necessary; and it was in balls and parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
and picnics and social meetings generally, that a
young woman had her chance of suddenly obtaining,
by looking pretty, by making herself agreeable, all
these good things at a stroke. She made up her
mind at once that heaven and earth must be moved
to get her an invitation to Mrs. Algernon Merridew's
<i>Th&eacute;s Dansantes</i>. She would not take, she said to
herself, any denial. She would see all the Redborough
people there, among whom there must certainly
be some individuals of the class upon which
depended Emma's fate. As she sat unfolding so
much of this as was needful with a calm confidence
in being understood, her grandparents, with a sort of
stupefaction, listened and looked on. Emma was
knitting all the time in the German way, with a very
slight swift movement of her fingers and without
looking at her work. She spoke slowly, with an air
of such undoubted fact and practical commonplace
about her, that those two old people, who each in
their several ways indulged in fancy and sentiment,
were daunted and silenced. Emma spoke in a sort
of saintly simplicity, as not knowing that anything
beyond those solid primitive foundations, anything
like sentiment or fancy, was in the world.</p>

<p>She was not handsome like her brother, and yet
there was something remarkable about her appearance
which some people admired. Her hair was
dark, her features sufficiently good. The strange
thing in her was her eyes, which were very light in
colour&mdash;so light, that sometimes there seemed no
colour at all in them. This was not beautiful, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
it was <i>bizarre</i> and unusual, and as such Emma had
her admirers. But it was only in this particular,
not in mind or thoughts, that there was anything in
her out of the way.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the old captain to his wife, when,
after having yawned softly over her work as a signal
and preparation for bed-going, Emma rose with a
smile at half-past ten, and kissed them both, and
asked if she might have her candle. "I must not
keep you out of bed," she said, with that look of
complacent consideration which, notwithstanding, was
quite innocent and referred to her own circumscribed
horizon, in which everything connected with herself
was well in the foreground. Mrs. Morgan did not
meet her husband's eye as she had met it when
Roland was the visitor.</p>

<p>"She has not been well brought up, poor thing!"
the old lady said. "She has had no one to care for
her&mdash;and, Rowley, she is our own flesh and blood."</p>

<p>"That's the wonderful thing," the captain said,
"Katie's child! My dear, I give it up; there seems
no reason and no sense in it. I cannot think what
the Lord can mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, hush, Rowley&mdash;nothing, nothing that is not
good."</p>

<p>"One would say&mdash;that there must be just a crowd
of souls ready to put into the new little bodies, and
that one must slip down before the other that ought
to come;&mdash;like that vile cad, you know, that slipped
into the pool of Siloam before the poor fellow that
had no servant could shuffle down."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"And that was all the better for your poor fellow
as it turned out, Rowley, for he got his healing more
sweetly out of the very hand&mdash;&mdash; And, poor little
spirit, if it was not intended for this body, I can't
think it has got very much by its deceit," Mrs.
Morgan said, with a little laugh.</p>

<p>But the captain did not laugh. There was consternation
in his soul.</p>

<p>"A girl," he said, "with her eyes open to all
chances, looking out for a husband, and seriously
thinking that is the right thing to do&mdash;to come from
you and me, Mary&mdash;to come from you and me!"</p>

<p>The old lady gave him her hands that he might
help her out of her chair, and when she stood upright,
tottering a little&mdash;for she was not strong upon
her legs&mdash;she gave him a little playful tap with her
finger upon his old cheek.</p>

<p>"You are just a high-flown old sentimentalist,"
she said. "There is no harm in her. She is only
prose to your poetry&mdash;which I've always been all our
lives, and you've said so many a day."</p>

<p>"Don't blaspheme, old woman, don't blaspheme,"
the captain said.</p>

<p>But next day, when Hester came in to give them
the account&mdash;which she knew the old people would
expect&mdash;of all that had happened, Emma lost no
time in making her desires known.</p>

<p>"It must have been a very pretty party," she
said; "a conservatory lighted like that is always so
nice. It is cool to sit in after you have got heated
with dancing. I wish I could have seen you all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
enjoying yourselves. I am so fond of dancing, and
I don't get much; for Roland does not care for
dancing parties, and at Waltham Elinor never had
time. I suppose you had an invitation, grandmamma,
though you are too old to go?"</p>

<p>Here Hester explained, wondering, that there were
very few chaperons, and nobody asked but people
who were known to dance.</p>

<p>"Ellen says it only tires the others, and what is
the use?" Hester said.</p>

<p>"That is very true; she must be judicious&mdash;she
must have right notions. When do you think
my invitation will come, grandmamma? I suppose
people will call when they know I am here?"</p>

<p>Here there was a little pause, for even Mrs.
Morgan was taken aback by this question, and did
not know what to say.</p>

<p>"I am sure," said Hester blushing, after a
minute's silence, "that if Miss Ashton would&mdash;like
it so very much&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I should, of course, <i>very</i> much. I want to
know the Redborough people. I like to know the
people wherever I go. It is so dull knowing no one,"
Emma said. "And then it would be so convenient,
you know, for I could go with&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>To this Hester did not know what to reply; but
it was well in one way that the new comer took it
all for granted and gave no trouble. Emma made
no account of embarrassed looks and hesitating
replies. She did not even notice them, but pursued
her own way deliberately, impervious to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
discouragement, which was more equivocal than a
flat "No." She had been used to "noes" very flat
and uncompromising, and everything less seemed to
her to mean assent. When she had disposed, as
she thought, of this question, she went on to
another which was of still greater importance.</p>

<p>"But I cannot expect Cousin Catherine to call
upon me," she said composedly. "She is too old,
and she is always treated as a kind of princess,
Roland says. And you are too old to take me,
grandmamma. Perhaps I could go with Hester.
Would that be the right thing? For they all say
I must not neglect Cousin Catherine."</p>

<p>Hester looked aghast upon the young woman, who
contemplated them so calmly over her knitting, and
talked of neglecting Catherine, and being called upon
by the sovereign of society, who left even the Redborough
magnates out, and called only upon those
who pleased her. Emma went on quite placidly, knitting
with the ends of her fingers in that phlegmatic
German way, which is an offence to English knitters.
The stocking went on dropping in longer and longer
lengths from her hands, as if twirling upon a leisurely
wheel. She had explained that they were knickerbocker
stockings, for Elinor's boys, which she was
always busy with.</p>

<p>"She gives me so much for them, for every dozen
pairs&mdash;and the wool; I make a little by it, and it is
much cheaper for her than the shops."</p>

<p>"Your grandfather will take you&mdash;some day," said
Mrs. Morgan hastily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that will do very well, but it ought to be
soon," Emma said. She returned to the subject
after Hester had given a further account of the
merrymaking of the previous night.</p>

<p>"Are you all great friends?" said Emma, "or are
there little factions as there generally are in families?
Elinor and William's wife used always to be having
tiffs, and then the rest of us had to take sides. I
never would. I thought it was wisest not. I was
nobody, you know, only the youngest. And when
one has to stay a few months here and a few months
there, without any home of one's own, it is best to
keep out of all these quarrels, don't you think,
grandmamma? Roland said there were some old
things living here, some old maids that were spiteful."</p>

<p>Now it is curious enough that though the Miss
Vernon-Ridgways were not at all approved by their
neighbours, it gave these ladies a shock to hear an
outsider describe them thus.</p>

<p>"Never mind that," said Mrs. Morgan, almost
impatiently. "Are you going further, Hester? If
you want my old man, tell him not to stay out too
long, for the wind is cold to-day."</p>

<p>"I am going to Redborough," Hester said. "I
have some things to do for mamma."</p>

<p>"Oh, you must take me with you," said Emma&mdash;"just
one moment till I have turned this heel. I
never like to leave a heel midway. I want to see
Redborough of all things. Grandmamma, you will
not mind me leaving you&mdash;I want to see all I can,
as I don't know how long I may stay."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you mind, Hester?" the old lady said in a
little alarm, as having finished the heel, and put her
knitting carefully away in a long basket made to
hold the length of her needles, Emma went up stairs
to get her hat. Hester laughed a little and hesitated,
for though she was not moved to enthusiasm by
Emma, she was young enough to like the novelty of
a new companion, whoever that might be.</p>

<p>"I hope she will not make me take her to see
Catherine. Catherine would not be very gracious
to any one whom I brought her. Dear Mrs.
Morgan, I wanted to ask you&mdash;Was Catherine&mdash;&mdash;Did
Catherine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;I can't tell you before any one. It
was something I heard from&mdash;&mdash;last night. Yes, I
am quite ready, Miss Ashton," Hester said.</p>

<p>"It is grand to be called Miss Ashton, but I wish
you would say Emma. It makes me feel as if I were
some one's governess when you say Miss Ashton. I
nearly was," said Emma. "You know we are a
large family, eight of us, and we had no money. I
am sure I can't tell how we managed to grow up.
It was thanks to Elinor I believe; she was the only
one who could manage papa. And now they are all
provided for, but only me. Elinor and Bee made
very good marriages, and Kate didn't do so badly
either, but she's gone to India. The others were to
help me between them, but that is not very nice.
They are always scheming to have as little of you as
they can, and to make the others have too much. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
never would give in to that. I always kept to my
day. I used to say 'No, Bee, my time is up. I
don't mind where you put me (for I never made any
fuss in that sort of way, it turns the servants against
you), I can sleep anywhere, but you must keep your
turn. Elinor sha'n't be put upon if I can help it,'
and the short and the long of it was that I had as
nearly as possible taken a governess's place."</p>

<p>"That would have been better surely&mdash;to be
independent," Hester said.</p>

<p>"In some ways. To have a paid salary would be
very nice&mdash;but it hurts a girl's chance. Oh, yes, it
does," said Emma, "there is no doubt of it: people
say not when they want to coax you into it, but it
does&mdash;and as all the others have married so well,
of course I was very unwilling to do anything to
damage my chance."</p>

<p>"What was your chance?" said Hester with a set
countenance: partly she did not know, and partly
from the context she divined, and meant to crush her
companion with lofty indignation: but Emma was
not quick enough to perceive the moral disapproval.
She was not even conscious that it was possible to
disapprove of such an elemental necessity.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know very well," she said with a little
laugh. "I have never been a flirt. I haven't got
any inclination that way. Of course in my position
I would think it my duty to consider any offer. But I
was very nearly driven to the governessing," she continued
calmly. "Elinor had visitors coming, and
Bee was so ill-natured as to start painting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
papering just as I was due there. Can you imagine
anything more nasty? just to be able to say she
could not take me in! I just said I must take a
situation, and they were in a way. But I do really
believe I should have done it had it not been for
Roland. He said it would suit him very well to
have me. He had just got a house of his own, you
know, and I could be of use to him. So he took me,
which was very kind. It is a little dull after being
used to children, but I have scarcely anything to do,
and he gives me a little allowance for my clothes.
Don't you think it is very kind?"</p>

<p>"I would much rather be a governess," Hester said
with a glow of indignant pride. This matter-of-fact
description of the state of dependence, which was
made without any sense of injury at all, with the
composure of an individual fully capable of holding
her own and looking for nothing else, had an effect
upon her sensitive mind which it is impossible to
describe. She shrank from the revelation as if it
had been something terrible; and yet it was not
terrible at all, but the most calm historic account of
a state of affairs which seemed perfectly natural to
every one concerned. Emma knew that she would
herself have employed any possible expedient to get
rid of an unnecessary member of her household,
especially such a detrimental as "the youngest"&mdash;and
she was not angry with Bee.</p>

<p>"Ah, you don't know children," said Emma
serenely. "I have been used to them all my life,
and I know what demons they are; and then it does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
so spoil your chances in life. Being with Roland is
very nice you know, he never orders me about, and
he gives me an allowance for my clothes, as I told
you. But it is much duller. At Elinor's and Bee's,
and even at William's, there's a little life going on.
Now and then you can't help seeing people. Even
when your sisters don't wish it, people will ask you
out when they know you're there. And I must say
that for Elinor, that when she's not worried she does
take a little trouble about you, and always likes to
see you look nice. To be sure with five boys and a
husband in business, she is worried," Emma added
with impartiality, "most of the time. What is that
big house, that red one, so near the road? Nice
people ought to live there."</p>

<p>"That is the Grange," said Hester, with a sudden
flush, "that is Catherine Vernon's house."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;h! But then why should I lose any time?
It would look better that I should go at once, the
very first day. I suppose you run in whenever you
please."</p>

<p>Hester's countenance flamed more than ever. "I
never go&mdash;except when I go with my mother.
Catherine would not care to see you with me. She
is very fond of your grandfather and grandmother&mdash;but
not so fond of us. And she is quite right, we
don't deserve it so much," Hester said, flinging back
her young head with that movement of natural pride
which belonged to her. Just then, to make the
situation more complicated, Edward came out from
the gate, and seeing the two figures on the road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
hesitated for a moment, conscious of Catherine's eye
behind him, and Hester's keen consciousness before.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Emma again, "then there <i>are</i> factions?
I am sure I am very glad grandpapa is on Catherine's
side; for Elinor said, and then Roland told me&mdash;&mdash; Who
is that? Oh, then, there are <i>men</i> there? I
thought she lived alone. He looks rather nice,
though I like men to be taller than that. Mind you
introduce me, and walk a little faster please, before
he gets away."</p>

<p>Hester's response to this was naturally the indignant
one of walking more slowly, so as to give the
hesitating figure at the gate full time to get away.
But Edward had thought better of it. On the whole,
he found it more undesirable to encounter Hester's
disdain than anything Catherine would be likely to
say. And just at that hour after luncheon Catherine
generally abandoned her seat in the window. It was
true that he very seldom came back to lunch. He
advanced accordingly a few steps from the door, and
held out his hand. "I am glad to see you are none
the worse of our dissipations last night," he said.</p>

<p>"Introduce me," said Emma, keeping her place
close to Hester's side, "we are all cousins together,
though we don't know each other. I wanted to go
in at once to see Cousin Catherine, whom I have
heard of all my life; but she will not let me. Perhaps
you will mention it to Cousin Catherine. I will
come as soon as I can get grandpapa to bring me. It
is so much more formal than I thought. Among
relations generally one runs out and in, and never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
thinks twice, but that does not seem to be your
way here."</p>

<p>"No, it is not our way here. We hold each other
at arm's length. We are not even civil if we can
help it," said Edward, with a laugh and a glance at
Hester, who stood, the impersonation of unwilling
politeness, holding herself back, in an attitude which
said as plainly as words, that though their way was
the same she did not choose to be accompanied, by
him, along even that common way.</p>

<p>"I see," said Emma. "I am sure I am very sorry
I made you stand and talk, Hester, when you dislike
it so much. Of course, among relations one understands
all that. Do you live here? I remember
now Roland told me there were some gentlemen-cousins,
but I am quite a stranger, and I don't know
anything. Hester is going to take me to see the
little town."</p>

<p>"You must not say 'little town' to any of the
Redborough people, Miss Ashton."</p>

<p>"Oh, mustn't I? At Waltham nobody minds. I
should like to see the Bank where all the Vernon
money comes from. The Vernon money has never
done us any good I believe, but still when one is
connected with money one likes to see all about it at
least. Do you think, Hester, this gentleman would
be so good as to see about my invitation? I don't
know if Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, I forget her name, who gives the
dances&mdash;is your sister, Mr. Vernon."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Merridew is my cousin," said Edward.</p>

<p>"Oh, cousin, is it? I suppose we are all cousins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Naturally I should like an invitation: but I suppose
it is because of the splits in the family, grandmamma
doesn't seem to wish to do anything about it, and
Hester hesitated, you know, just as you hesitated,
Mr. Vernon, before you came to speak to us. What
a pity that there should be such to-does: but where
there are a large number of people in a family, of
course it can't always be helped. I have always
found gentlemen were more good-natured than ladies
about getting one invitations. If you were to tell
Mrs. Merridew I am here, even if she didn't think
it right to call as most people would, at least she
might send me a ticket. I can't have anything to
do with either side, seeing I only arrived yesterday,
and don't know a word about it: but I do like to
make acquaintance with a place wherever I go."</p>

<p>"I will see that my cousin sends you an invitation,
Miss Ashton, at least if she will do what I ask
her. I have got my work waiting me. Pardon me
if I go on."</p>

<p>"Oh, we are going the same way. I suppose we
are going the same way?" said Emma, looking at
her companion.</p>

<p>"You walk quicker than we do, and I dare say you
are in a hurry," said Hester ungraciously. She did
not respond to the look of mingled reproach and
relief which he gave her. The very vicinity of
Catherine Vernon's house stiffened Hester into
marble, and Edward was very anxious to go on. He
stood still for one moment with his hat in his hand,
then hastened on, at a rate very little like his usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
mode of progression. Hester on her part followed
with studious lingering, pausing to point out to her
companion the view over the Common, the roofs of
the Redborough houses, the White House on the
opposite slope. Emma naturally conceived her own
suspicions from this curious piece of pantomime.
They had been walking smartly before, they walked
slowly now&mdash;and hers was what she thought a
romantic imagination. She felt confident that these
two were true lovers separated by some family
squabble, and that they did not venture to be seen
walking together. "I know we were going the same
way," she said, "because there are not two ways, and
you can see the town before you. I can't see why
we might not have walked together. It is sinful to
carry family tiffs so far," Emma said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<h3>A DOUBLE MIND.</h3>


<p>Edward had drawn his bow at a venture when he
made that statement about Catherine to Hester, and
he was full of doubt as to how it would influence
her. This was the first time almost that he had disregarded
opinion and withdrawn the bolts and bars
and let himself go. There was something in the
atmosphere of the young house, all breathing of life
and freedom, and daring disregard of all trammels,
which got into his head in spite of himself. He had
abandoned altogether the decorous habits of his life,
the necessity which bound him as surely in a dance
as at his office. On ordinary occasions, wherever
a ball occurred in Redborough, Edward was aware
beforehand which young ladies he would have to
dance with, and knew that he must apportion his
attentions rightly, and neglect nobody whose father
or mother had been civil to him. He knew that he
must not dance too often with one, nor sit out in
corners, nor do anything unbecoming a young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
upon whom the eyes of many were fixed. But the
very air in the house of the Merridews was different
from that of other places. There was a licence in it
which existed nowhere else. He, the staid and grave,
carried off Hester from her partners, appropriated
her for a good part of the evening, sat with her
hidden away among the ferns in the conservatory, and
only resigned her when he was compelled to do so.
Even then, by way of emphasising his choice of
Hester, he scarcely danced at all after, but stood
among the other disengaged men in the doorways,
watching her and seizing every opportunity to gain
her attention. He was startled at himself when he
thought of it. He walked home in the middle of
the night, in the faint wintry moonlight, following
the old fly he heard lumbering off in the distance
carrying her home, his mind filled with a curious
excitement and sense of self-abandonment. He had
always admired her&mdash;her independence, her courage,
her eager intelligence, had furnished him since she
was a child with a sort of ideal. He had kept
wondering what kind of woman she would grow up;
and lo! here she was, a woman grown, drawing
other eyes than his, the object of admiring glances
and complimentary remarks. When he had seen
her in her washed muslin at Catherine Vernon's
parties, she had still appeared to him a child, or
little more than a child. He had still felt the
superiority of his own position, and that the passing
glance and shrug of familiar confidential half-apology
would probably please her more than the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
attentions which he had to show among so many.
But Hester, by Ellen Merridew's side, a taller and
grander woman, well-dressed, with her mother's
pearls about her white throat, which was as white as
they, was a different creature altogether. To risk
everything for a mere school-girl was one thing, but
a stately young creature like this, at whom everybody
looked, of whom everybody said, "<i>That</i> Hester
Vernon? Dear me, I never thought she had grown
up like that!" was a different matter. The sight of
her had intoxicated Edward. Perhaps poor Mrs.
John's pearls and the careful perfection of her dress
had something to do with it. And the place intoxicated
him. There every one was doing what seemed
good in his own sight. There were few or none of
those stern reminders which he had read elsewhere
in the eyes of parents whose daughters were waiting
to be danced with, the "Was-it-for-this-I-asked-you-to-dinner?"
look, to which he had so often succumbed.
For once he had lost his head; he was even vaguely
conscious that he had come there with a sort of
intention of losing his head, and for once thinking of
his own pleasure, and nothing more. No doubt this
had been in his mind: and the sudden sight of that
white figure, all graceful and stately, and of Mrs.
John's pearls, had done the rest. But he was a little
nervous next morning as he thought over what he
had been doing; he did not bear Catherine's questioning
well at breakfast. When she asked him
whom he had danced with, he made answer that he
had danced very little. But yet he had enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
himself, oh yes. It had been so pretty a party that
it had been pleasure enough to look on. He described
the conservatory and its Chinese lanterns with enthusiasm.
"It must, indeed, have been like fairyland&mdash;or
the fireworks at the Crystal Palace," Catherine
had said. And he had felt a bitter pang of offence,
as she laughed. He did not feel, indeed, that he
could bear any remarks of the kind, or depreciation
of Ellen, for whom he felt a special kindness just
now. When Catherine said, "But all this must have
come to a great deal of money: Algernon Merridew
has only a share in his father's business, he has no
private money, has he?&mdash;but, of course I know he
has no private means: and Ellen's little money will
soon go at that rate."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose Chinese lanterns cost very much,"
said Edward.</p>

<p>"Your temper is doubtful this morning," said
Catherine, with a smile. "It is 'on the go,' which
is usual enough after late hours and the excitement
of a dance; but I don't think you are often so much
excited by a dance. Did you see some one whom
you admired, Edward? I am sure, if she is a nice
girl, I shall be very glad."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be as well not to try, Aunt
Catherine; we might not agree about what a nice
girl is."</p>

<p>"No?" said Catherine rather wistfully.</p>

<p>She looked into his doubtful eyes across the breakfast
table, and, perhaps for the first time, began to
feel that she was not so very certain as she had once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
been as to what her boy meant. Was it possible
after all, that perhaps the words upon which they
agreed had different meanings to each? But this
was only a passing cloud.</p>

<p>"Who was the belle?" she said smiling; "you
can tell me that, at least, if you can't tell who you
admired most."</p>

<p>Edward paused; and then an impulse of audacity
seized him.</p>

<p>"I don't know if you will like it," he said, "but
if I must tell the truth, I think that girl at the
Vernonry&mdash;Hester, you know, who is grown up, it
appears, and <i>out</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Catherine bore the little shock with great self-possession,
but she felt it.</p>

<p>"Hester. Why should you suppose I would not
like it? She must be nineteen, and, of course, she is
<i>out</i>. And what of her?" Catherine said, with a
grave smile.</p>

<p>She was vexed that Edward should be the one to
tell her of the girl's success, and she was vexed, too,
that he should think it would displease her. Why
should it displease her? He ought to have kept
silence on the subject, and he ought not to have
seemed to know that she had any feeling upon it:
the suggestion hurt her pride.</p>

<p>"Ellen seems to have taken her up. She has
grown up much handsomer than I should have expected,
and she was very well dressed, with beautiful
pearls&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Catherine, with a long breath; "then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
her mother kept her pearls!" She laughed a moment
after, and added, "Of course, she would; what
could I have expected? She kept her settlement.
Poor little thing! I suppose she did not understand
what it meant, and that she was cheating her
husband's creditors."</p>

<p>"I never quite understood," said Edward, "why
you should have brought her here, and given her a
house, when she is still in possession of that income."</p>

<p>"She has only a scrap of it. Poor little thing!
She neither knew it was wrong to take it, nor that if
she did keep it, it ought not to have been allowed to
go for his after debts. She got muddled altogether
among them. The greater part of it she mortgaged
for him, so that there was only a pittance left.
Whatever you may think, you young men, it is a
drawback for a man when he marries a fool. And
so she kept her pearls!" Catherine added, with a
laugh of contempt.</p>

<p>"Marrying a fool, however, must have its advantages,"
said Edward, "since a woman with
brains would probably have given up the settlement
altogether."</p>

<p>"Advantages&mdash;if you think them advantages!"
Catherine said, with a flash of her eyes such as
Edward had seldom seen. "And certainly would
not have kept the pearls&mdash;which are worth a good
deal of money," she added, however, with her habitual
laugh. "I think they must have dazzled you, my
boy, these pearls."</p>

<p>"I am sure they did," said Edward composedly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
"they took away my breath. I have seen her here
often, a dowdy little girl" (he scorned himself for
saying these words, yet he said them, though even
his cheek reddened with the sense of self-contempt)
"with no ornaments at all."</p>

<p>"No," said Catherine; "to do Mrs. John justice,
she had as much sense as that. She would not have
put those pearls on a girl's neck, unless she was
dressed conformably. Oh, she has sense enough for
that. I suppose she had a pretty dress&mdash;white? But
of course it would be white; at the first ball&mdash;and
looked well, you say?"</p>

<p>"Very handsome," said Edward, gravely. He did
not look up to meet the look of awakened alarm,
wonder, doubt, and rousing up of her faculties to
meet a new danger, which was in Catherine's eyes.
He kept his on his plate and ate his breakfast with
great apparent calm, though he knew very well, and
had pleasure in thinking, that he had planted an
arrow in her. "By the way," he said, after an interval,
"where did John Vernon pick his wife up?
I hear she is of good family&mdash;and was it her extravagance
that brought about his ruin? These are
details I have never heard."</p>

<p>"It is not necessary to enter into such old stories,"
said Catherine, somewhat stiffly. "He met her, I
suppose, as young men meet unsuitable people everywhere;
but we must do justice. I don't think she
had any share in the ruin, any more at least than a
woman's legitimate share," she added, with a laugh
that was somewhat grim. "He was fond of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
kind of indulgence, and then speculated to mend
matters. Beware of speculation, Edward. Extravagance
is bad, but speculation is ruin. In the one
case you may have to buy your pleasures very dear,
but in the other there is no pleasure, nothing but
destruction and misery."</p>

<p>"Is not that a little hard, Aunt Catherine? there
is another side to it. Sometimes a colossal fortune
instead of destruction, as you say; and in the meantime
a great deal of excitement and interest, which
are pleasures in their way."</p>

<p>"The pleasure of balancing on the point of a
needle over the bottomless pit," she said. "If I
were not very sure that you have too much sense to
be drawn into anything of the kind, I should take
fright, to hear you say even as much as that. The
very name of speculation is a horror to me."</p>

<p>"Yet there must always be a little of it in business,"
he said, with a smile creeping about the
corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>"You think me old-fashioned in my notions, and
with a woman's incapacity to understand business;
but in my day we managed to do very well without
it," Catherine said.</p>

<p>"To think of a woman's incapacity for business in
your presence would be silly indeed. I hope I am
not such an ass as that," said Edward, looking up at
her with a smile. And she thought his look so kind
and true, so full of affectionate filial admiration and
trust, that Catherine's keen perceptions were of no
more use to her than the foolishness of any mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>He returned to luncheon that day as if for the
purpose of obliterating all disagreeable impressions,
and it was on leaving the Grange to return to the
bank that he met Hester and Emma. This confused
and annoyed him for the moment. It was not so
that he would have liked to meet the heroine of last
night; and her unknown companion, and the highly
inappropriate place of meeting, made the encounter
still less to his taste. But when he had hurried on
in advance he began to ask himself what was the
meaning of Hester's reluctance to walk with him,
or even to speak to him, her attitude&mdash;drawing back
even from his greeting, and the clouded look in her
eyes. It was natural that he should not wish to
speak to her at the door of the Grange, but why
she should wish to avoid him he could not tell. It
would have been a triumph over Catherine to have
thus demonstrated her acquaintance with him at
Catherine's very door. So Edward thought, having
only the vulgar conception of feminine enmity. On
the whole, seeing that he had sowed the seeds of
suspicion in Catherine's bosom, it was better that
Hester should hold him at arm's length. Yet he
was piqued by it. When he reached the bank,
however, news awaited him, which turned his
thoughts in a different channel. He found Harry
Vernon and Algernon Merridew in great excitement
in the room which was sacred to the former. Ashton
had made the first <i>coup</i> on their behalf. He had
bought in for them, at a fabulously low price, certain
stock by which in a few weeks he was confident they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
might almost double their ventures. To furnish the
details of this operation is beyond the writer's power,
but the three young men understood it, or thought
they understood it. Of course a skilful buyer prowling
about a crowded market with real money in his
pocket, knowing what he wants, and what is profitable,
will be likely to get his money's worth, whether
he is buying potatoes or stock.</p>

<p>"I saw it was very low," said Merridew, "and
wondered at the time if Ashton would be down
upon it. I thought of writing to him, but on the
whole I suppose it's best not to cramp them in their
operations. They ought to know their own business
best."</p>

<p>"They shell it out when there's a good thing going,
these fellows do," said Harry, out of his moustache.</p>

<p>"And nobody has any money apparently," Algernon
said, with a laugh of pleasure, meaning to imply
<i>save you and me</i>. "When money's tight, that is the
time to place a little with advantage," he said with a
profound air. "I think you should go in for it on a
larger scale, you two fellows that have the command
of the bank."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't risk too much at once," Harry said.</p>

<p>Edward listened to their prattle with a contempt
which almost reached the length of passion. To
hear them talk as if they understood, or as if it
mattered what they thought! His own brains were
swelling with excitement. He knew that he could
go a great deal further if he pleased, and that
Harry's share in the decision would be small.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Dancing on the point of a needle over the bottomless
pit! It was like an old woman's insane objection
to anything daring&mdash;anything out of the common
way. Ashton's letter to him was far longer and
more detailed than his communications with the
others. He said plainly that here was an opportunity
for an operation really upon a grand scale,
and that there could be no doubt of a dazzling
success. "You will communicate just as much or
as little of this as you think proper to the others,"
Roland wrote, and it was all that Edward could do
to keep up an appearance of replying to them, of
joining in their gratification as he pondered this
much more important proposal. "It is not once in
a dozen years that such a chance arises," Roland said.</p>

<p>Now Edward had nothing of his own to speak
of, far less than the others, who each had a trifle of
independent fortune. All that he could risk was
the money of the bank. The profit, if profit there
was, would be to the bank, and even that large
increase of profit would have its drawbacks, for
Catherine, who liked to know everything, would
inquire into it, and in her opinion, success would be
scarcely less dangerous than failure. He could not
stop in the drab-coloured calm of the office where
these two young idiots were congratulating each
other, and trying to talk as if they knew all about
it. His scorn of them was unspeakable. If they
gained a hundred pounds their elation would be
boundless. They were like boys sending out a little
toy frigate and enchanted when it reached in safety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the opposite side of the puddle. But Ashton meant
business. It was not for this sort of trifling work
that he had set himself to watch those fluctuations,
which are more delicate than anything in nature
they could be compared to. The blowing of the
winds and their changes were prose compared to
the headlong poetry of the money-market. Edward
felt so many new pulses waking in him, such a
hurrying fever in his veins, that he could not control
himself.</p>

<p>"You'll be here, I suppose, Harry, till closing
time? I'm going out," he said.</p>

<p>"You going out&mdash;you that never have anything
to do out of doors! I had to umpire in a match on
the other side of the Common," said Harry, "but
if you'll just tell Cordwainer as you pass to get
some one else in my place, I don't mind staying.
I'm sure you've done it often, Ned, for me."</p>

<p>"I am not in request, like you; but I have something
I want to see to, to-day."</p>

<p>"All right," said Harry. "Don't you go and
overdo it, whatever it is."</p>

<p>"You are seedy with staying up, dancing and
flirting," said young Merridew, with his imbecile
laugh. "Nelly says she could not believe her eyes."</p>

<p>"I wish Ellen, and you too, would understand
that dancing and flirting are entirely out of my
way," said Edward, with a flush of anger, as he took
his hat and went out.</p>

<p>Poor Algernon's innocent joke was doubly unsuccessful,
for Harry stood perfectly glum, not moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
a muscle. He had not been at all amused by the
proceedings of the previous night.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't report it, if I were you, when Ellen
says silly things," said her brother, as black as a
thunder-cloud.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said poor Merridew, falling from his
eminence of satisfaction into the ludicrous dismay
of undeserved depreciation. He told his wife after,
"They both set upon me tooth and nail, when I
meant nothing but to be pleasant."</p>

<p>"I wish you would learn, Algernon, that it's always
wise to hold your tongue when I'm not there," Ellen
said. "Of course I understand my own family.
And not much wonder they were vexed! Edward
that doesn't look at a girl because of Aunt Catherine,
and Harry that she has snubbed so! You could
not have chosen a worse subject to be pleasant
upon," Mrs. Ellen said.</p>

<p>But it was not this subject that was in Edward's
mind as he sallied forth with the step and the air
of that correct and blameless man of business which
already all Redborough believed him to be. He had
taken that aspect upon him in the most marvellous
way&mdash;the air of a man whose mind was balanced
like his books, as regularly, and without the variation
of a farthing. He was one of those who are born
punctual, and already his morning appearance was
as a clock to many people on the outskirts of
Redborough. His hat, his gloves, his very umbrella,
were enough to give people confidence.
There was nobody who would have hesitated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
entrust their money to his hands. But if Redborough
could have known, as he passed along the streets,
causing a little wonder to various people&mdash;for
already it had become a surprising fact that Mr.
Edward should leave business at so much earlier an
hour than usual&mdash;what a wild excitement was passing
through Edward's veins, the town would have
been soared out of its composure altogether. He
scarcely felt the pavement under his feet; he
scarcely knew which way he was turning. The
message for Cordwainer went out of his head,
though he went that way on purpose. Several
important questions had come before him to be
settled since he had taken his place at the head
of the bank. He had been called upon to decide
whether here and there an old customer who had
not thriven in the world should be allowed to
borrow, or a new one permitted to overdraw; and
in such cases he had stood upon the security of the
bank with a firmness which was invulnerable, and
listened to no weak voices of pity. But this was
far more important than such questions as these. As
his ideas disentangled themselves, there seemed to be
two possibilities before him. If he threw himself
into Ashton's scheme at all, to do it as a partner
in the business, not indeed with the sanction of
his other partners, but, if there was risk to the firm
in his proceedings at large, to make them profitable
to it in case of success. In case of success! Of
course there would be success. It was inevitable
that they must succeed. On the other side, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
expedient was to use the money and the securities
of the bank, not for the aggrandisement of Vernon's,
but for his own. This would leave the responsibility
of the action entirely upon his own shoulders if
anything went wrong. And he did not refuse to
give a rapid glance at that contingency. What could
it mean to the bank? Not ruin&mdash;he half-smiled
as he thought. It would mean coming down perhaps
in the world, descending from the <i>prestige</i> and importance
of its present rank. And to himself it
would mean going to the dogs&mdash;anyhow, there could
be no doubt on that point. But on the other side!
that was better worth looking at, more worthy of
consideration. It would be like pouring in new
blood to stagnant veins; it would be new life coming
in, new energy, something that would stir the old
fabric through and through, and stimulate its steady-going,
old-fashioned existence. It would be the something
he had longed for&mdash;the liberating influence,
new possibilities, more extended work. He thought,
with an excitement that gradually overmastered
him, of the rush of gain coming in like a river, and
the exhilaration and new force it would bring. This
idea caught him up as a strong wind might have
caught him, and carried him beyond his own control.
He walked faster and faster, skimming along
the road that led into the country, into the quiet,
where no one could note his altered aspect or the
excitement that devoured him, taking off his hat as
he got out of sight of the houses, to let the air blow
upon his forehead and clear his senses. And by and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
by things began to become more clear. He read
Ashton's letter over again, and with every word the
way seemed to grow plainer, the risks less. It was
as near a dead certainty as anything could be in
business. "Of course there is always a possibility
that something unforeseen may happen," Ashton
wrote, "and it is for you to weigh this. I think
myself that the chance is so infinitesimal as not to
be worth taking into consideration; but I would not
wish to bias your judgment; the only thing is, that
the decision must be immediate." Now that the
first shock of novelty was over, he felt it in his
power to "weigh this," as Ashton said. Getting
familiarised with the subject made him more impartial,
he said to himself. The first mention of it
had raised a cowardly host of apprehensions and
doubts, but now that the throbbing of excitement
began to die away, he saw the matter as it was&mdash;a
question of calculation, a delicate operation, a
good <i>coup</i>, but all within the legitimate limits of
business. He had recovered, he felt, the use of his
reason, which the novelty, the necessity for immediate
determination, the certainty that he must take
no counsel on the subject, that Harry would be
dumbly obstinate, and Catherine anxiously, hortatively,
immovably against it, had taken away.
Harry was an ass, he said to himself, recovering
his calm, and Aunt Catherine an old woman. What
was the use of the faculties he possessed, and the
position he had gained, if in such a crisis he could
not act boldly and for himself!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it was with a very different aspect that
Edward walked back. He put on his hat, feeling
himself cooled and subdued; his pulses returned to
their usual rate of beating, which was essentially a
moderate one. And so rapidly had he skimmed
over the ground, and so quick had been the progress
both of his steps and his thoughts, that when he
got back, with his mind made up, to the skirts of
the Common, he saw the football party just beginning
to assemble, and recollected that he had never
given Harry's message to Cordwainer, and that
accordingly no new umpire could have been found
in Harry's place. But what did that matter? He
reflected benevolently, with a contemptuous good
nature, that he could get back to the bank in time
still to liberate his cousin, so that everybody would
be satisfied. This he did, stopping at the telegraph
office on the way. His despatch was as follows:&mdash;"Proceed,
but with caution. Needful will be forthcoming."
He drew a long breath when he thus
decided his fate; then he returned with all the ease
and relief which naturally comes with a decision.
The thing was done, whether for good or evil&mdash;and
there could be very little doubt that it was for good.
His countenance was cheerful and easy as he returned
to the bank.</p>

<p>"I did not give your message, for my business
did not keep me so long as I expected. Your football
fellows are just collecting. You can get there,
if you make haste, before they begin."</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks, awfully!" said Harry. "I hope you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
did not hurry, though I'm glad to go. I hope you
understand I'm always ready to stay, Ned, when
you want the time. Of course, you're worth two
of me here, I know that; but I can't stand anything
that's not fair, and if you want to get
away&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't, old fellow; I've done my business. It did
not take so long as I thought. You had better be off
if you want to get there in time."</p>

<p>"All right," said Harry. And he went off to his
match in a softened state of mind, which, had he
been able to divine it, would have astonished Edward
greatly. Harry had seen Hester and her companion
pass, and he felt a sad conviction that Edward's sudden
business had something to do with that apparition.
Well! he had said to himself, and what then? Hadn't
he a right to try, the same as another? If she liked
one better than the other, should the fellow she
wouldn't have be such a cad as to stand in her way?
This was what had made Harry "fly out," as Algy
said, upon his brother-in-law; it had made him pass
a very sombre hour alone in the bank. But in the
revulsion of feeling at Edward's rapid return, and the
likelihood either that he had not seen Hester, or that
she would have nothing to say to him, Harry's heart
was moved within him. Either his cousin was "in
the same box" as himself and rejected, or else he was
innocent altogether of evil intention&mdash;and in either
case Harry's heart was soft to him: at once as one
whom he had wronged, and as one who might be
suffering with him under a common calamity.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<h3>STRAIGHTFORWARD.</h3>


<p>"I hope, Cousin Catherine," said Emma, "that
you will not think it is any want of civility on my
part. I wished very much to come the first day. I
went out with Hester Vernon, who is constantly at
grandpapa's&mdash;and I was quite distressed, when I
found we had to pass here, that she would not bring
me in to call. But she seemed to think you would
rather not. Of course I know that there are often
tiffs in families, so I wouldn't say anything. There
are times when Elinor wouldn't call on William's
wife not if life and death depended on it; so I understand
quite well, and of course a stranger mustn't
interfere. Only I wish you to know that I had no
wish to take sides, and didn't mean to be rude.
That was the last thing in the world I intended.
Elinor has always told us younger ones so much
about you."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of Elinor, I am sure; and you
have behaved most judiciously," said Catherine, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
a twinkle in her eye. "It is unnecessary to say to a
person of your judgment that in the best regulated
family&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't tell me," said Emma, shaking
her head. "Nobody can know better than I do. It
is very awkward when you are the youngest, and
when you are expected by everybody to take their
part. Of course they have all been very kind to me.
I live part of my time with one, and part with
another, and that is why every one thinks I should
be on their side. But now I am very independent,"
Emma said, "for Roland has taken me. I dare say
he would tell you, Cousin Catherine, when he was
here."</p>

<p>"That must be a very pleasant arrangement," said
Catherine, with a smile. "I suppose when you were
with Elinor you had a good deal to do."</p>

<p>"I do Roland's housekeeping now. I don't wish
to be idle," said Emma. "But to be sure when there
are children to be seen after you are never done, and
especially boys. Elinor has five boys!&mdash;it is something
dreadful! The stockings and the mending you
can't think! It is very nice being with Roland; he
is most kind. He gives me a regular allowance for
my clothes, which I never got before, and I am sure it
is very good of him; but you can't have everything,
you know, and it is a little dull. He is out all day,
and often in the evenings, for of course I shouldn't
wish him to give up his gentlemen-engagements for
me. I don't think people should ever do that sort of
thing. Tom Pinch is all very well in Dickens, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
would be inconvenient in actual life; for suppose you
married?&mdash;and of course that is what every girl
expects to do."</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Catherine. "Is there anything
of that sort in prospect, if I may be permitted to
ask?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I am quite pleased that you should
ask," said Emma. "It would be such a comfort to
have somebody like you to come and talk it over
with, Cousin Catherine, if there was anything&mdash;for I
should feel sure you could tell me about my trousseau
and all that. But there is nothing, I am sorry to say.
You see I have had so little chance. Elinor took me
out sometimes, but not much, and she was far more
disposed to amuse herself than to introduce me. I
don't think that is nice in a married sister, do you?
and speaking of that, Cousin Catherine, I am sure
you will be kind enough to help me here. Grandpapa
will not take any trouble about it. I asked
the gentleman whom we met coming out of
here, Hester and I&mdash;Mr. Edward I think is his
name."</p>

<p>"What of Edward?" said Catherine quickly, with
a touch of alarm.</p>

<p>"But nothing seems to have come of it," said the
persistent Emma. "He said he would try, and
Hester made a sort of promise; but there has been
one since and I have never been asked. It is your
niece's dance&mdash;Mrs. Merridew, I think, is her name.
She gives one every week, and both for a little
amusement, and that I mayn't lose any chance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
may be going, I should like very much to go. I
don't doubt that you could get me an invitation
in a moment if you would just say you would
like it."</p>

<p>Catherine's consternation was ludicrous to behold.
She was herself so much amused by the situation
that she laughed till the tears stood in her eyes.
But this matter-of-fact young woman who sat by and
gazed upon her with such a stolid incapacity to see
the joke, was of the side of the house to which
Catherine could pardon anything&mdash;the old captain's
grandchild, Roland's sister. What would have been
vulgar assurance in another, was amusing <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> in
Emma. When she had got over her laugh she said,
with amused remonstrance as if she had been speaking
to a child&mdash;</p>

<p>"But you must know, Emma, that these family
tiffs you are so well accustomed to, come in to
prevent this too. Ellen would not care for my
recommendation. She is a very self-willed little
person, and indeed the chief rebel of the family."</p>

<p>"That is all very well, Cousin Catherine," said
Emma with the downrightness of fact and certainty;
"but you know you are the head of the family. You
have got the money. If they were in trouble they
would all have to come to you: and if you said "I
wish this," of course nobody would venture to refuse
you. The most stupid person must be sure of that."</p>

<p>There was a commanding commonsense in this view
that silenced Catherine. She looked at the young
philosopher almost with awe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your arguments are unanswerable," she said;
"there is nothing to be said against such admirable
logic."</p>

<p>"Then you will ask for an invitation for me?"
said Emma. "I am sure I am much obliged to you,
Cousin Catherine. It is always best to come to the
fountain-head. And it isn't as if I were going to
cause any expense or trouble, for I have my ball-dress
all ready. I have wore it only once, and it is quite
fresh. It is my second ball-dress; the first I wore
about a dozen times. Elinor gave it me, which was
very kind of her. It was only muslin, but really it
was very nice, and got up quite respectably. But
this one I bought myself out of the allowance Roland
gives me. Don't you think it is very thoughtful of
him? for of course what a sister buys for you, however
kind she is, is never just the same as what you
would choose for yourself."</p>

<p>"I suppose not&mdash;I never had any experience," said
Catherine, gravely. "I am afraid, however, that you
will not meet anybody who will much advance your
views at Redborough. It is an old-fashioned, backward
place. London would afford a much larger
scope for any social operations. Indeed it is very
condescending in a young lady from town to give
any attention to us and our little parties down
here."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Emma, eager to correct a mistake,
"that just shows how little people in the country
know. You think London means the London you
read of in books, where you meet all the great people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
and have half-a-dozen parties every night. But when
London means Kilburn!" said Emma shaking her
head, "where all the gentlemen go to the city every
morning, and there is perhaps one dance given in a
whole season, and only the people asked that you
know! and we know scarcely one. You see the
people there don't think of calling because they are
your neighbours. There are so many: and unless
you get introductions, or work in the parish, or something&mdash; Working
in the parish is a very good way,"
Emma added, with a sudden recollection; "you get
invited to a great many evening parties where you
just stand about and talk, or people sing: and not
many dances. Unfortunately I never was much used
to parish work. In Elinor's there was too much to do,
and Bee was too worldly, and as for William's wife,
though we should not like it to be known, Cousin
Catherine, she is&mdash;a Dissenter."</p>

<p>Emma made this admission with the reluctance it
merited.</p>

<p>"I have not told grandpapa," she said, with bated
breath.</p>

<p>"I think he could bear it," said Catherine. "I
think you might venture on the communication.
In some things he is very strong-minded."</p>

<p>"It was a very bitter pill to us," Emma
said.</p>

<p>Here they were interrupted by the entrance of
the captain himself, who had left his grandchild in a
cowardly way to make Catherine's acquaintance by
herself. But Emma had not minded. She had not even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
divined that his pretence of business was hypocritical.
She had not been alarmed by Catherine, and now she
was comfortably confident of having made a good
impression, and secured a friend.</p>

<p>"I am quite ready, grandpapa," she said. "Cousin
Catherine has been so kind. She says she will speak
to Mrs. Merridew about my invitation, so you may
make yourself quite easy on that subject. And grandmamma
will be very pleased. Of course I could not
expect such an old lady as she is to exert herself.
But Cousin Catherine understands how important
that sort of thing is to a girl," Emma said, with an air
of great gravity.</p>

<p>The captain gave Catherine a piteous glance. He
did not understand the new specimen of womankind
of whom he had the responsibility, and Catherine,
whose powers of self-restraint had been called forth
to an unusual degree, responded with an outburst of
laughter.</p>

<p>"We have got on admirably," she said. "I like
a straightforward mind, with such a power of
applying reason to practical uses. You must come
to see me often, Emma. Never mind grandpapa.
He will tell you I am busy, but when I am so, I
shall tell you so. You are far too sensible to take
offence."</p>

<p>"Oh, offence, Cousin Catherine? between you
and me!" said Emma, "that would be too ridiculous.
I hope I know my place. When you are the youngest
you soon learn that. Your first lesson is that nobody
wants you, and that you must just do the best you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
can for yourself. There is only just one thing I
should like to mention, and that is, that the first
time it would be a great advantage to me if you
would take me. It is such a fine thing for a girl
when she is known to belong to the best people in a
place. It is not even as if my name were Vernon.
But people will say 'Miss Ashton! who is Miss
Ashton? I never heard of her!' Whereas if I were
with you, the best partners in the place would ask
to get introduced to me, and that would give me
a start. Afterwards I could get on by myself, as I
hear Mrs. Merridew does not care for chaperons,"
Emma said.</p>

<p>Once more Catherine was struck dumb. She
pushed her chair back a little and regarded this
dauntless young woman with a mixture of dismay,
admiration, and amusement.</p>

<p>"But I assure you I have never gone to any of
Ellen's junketings," she said.</p>

<p>"That will not matter," said the persistent Emma,
"Of course she will be pleased to have you. It will
be a great honour. And then to me it would be such
an advantage. I should feel that I really was having
my chance."</p>

<p>When she left the gate of the Grange, walking by
the side of the bewildered captain, Emma felt that
she was tolerably sure of getting all she wanted, and
her triumph, though quite moderate and serious, was
great.</p>

<p>"I am very glad you left me to make acquaintance
with Cousin Catherine by myself," she said, "grandpapa;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
I was a little frightened, but she was so nice.
She was very nice to Roland too; and it will be such
an advantage to go into society for the first time
with such a well-known person. It makes all the
difference. People see at once who you are, and
there is no difficulty afterwards."</p>

<p>"And you think Catherine Vernon will depart
from all her habits and take you to that butterfly's
ball?" the captain said.</p>

<p>"Of course, grandpapa," said Emma, in the calm
of simple conviction. It was not a matter which
admitted of any doubt.</p>

<p>And the wonderful thing was, that she proved
right. To her own great amazement, and to the
consternation of everybody concerned, Catherine
Vernon assumed her grey gown, the gayest of her
evening garments, and most befitting a dance, and
took Emma Ashton in her own carriage to Mrs.
Merridew's house on the hill. Catherine was too
genial a person in ordinary society to exercise any
discouraging influence upon the young party in
general; but upon the members of her own family
there was no doubt that she did have a subduing
effect. Ellen's face of consternation was the subject
of remark in the family for years after; indeed, they
spoke of "the night when Aunt Catherine came to
the dance," dating things from it, as people speak
of a great national event. Harry was the one who
showed himself most equal to the occasion. He
established himself by Catherine's side as a sort of
guard of honour, relieving the frightened Algernon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
who, what with pride and pleasure on his own part,
and a wondering sympathy with Ellen's dismay, did
not know how to conduct himself in such an emergency.
Edward did not appear at all. He had said
he was very busy, and did not think it was possible
he could go, as soon as he heard of Emma's extraordinary
request. And though Catherine was almost
displeased by his defection, there was nothing to be
said against so evident a necessity as that the most
active partner in the bank should attend to his work.
Her chief point of curiosity in the scene which she
surveyed with amused disapproval and astonishment
to find herself there, was Hester, to whom her eyes
turned with the lively sense of opposition which
existed always between the two.</p>

<p>Catherine's eyes, in spite of herself, turned from
Emma's insignificance to the fine indignant figure
of the girl whom (she said to herself) she could not
endure, with the most curious mixture of curiosity,
and interest, and rivalship. She, Catherine Vernon,
the rival of a trifling creature of nineteen! Such
a sentiment sometimes embitters the feelings of a
mother towards the girl of whom her son makes
choice. But Catherine's mood had nothing to do
with Edward. It was more like the "taking sides,"
which Emma was so anxious to demonstrate was
impossible to her as a stranger. Hester had no
separate standing ground, no might or authority,
and yet it was no exaggeration to say that Catherine,
with all of these advantages, instinctively looked
upon her as a rival power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>Hester was in the blue dress, which was the
alternative of her white one. In those days there
were no yellows or sage greens; and even before
Catherine remarked the girl's young freshness and
beauty, or the high-thrown head, and indignant
bearing, which denoted on Hester's side a sense
of Catherine's inspection, her eyes had caught the
glistening pearls on the young neck&mdash;her mother's
pearls. Catherine looked at them with a mingled
sense of pity and disdain. If that mother had been
such a woman as Catherine, neither these pearls nor
anything else of value would have remained in her
hands. They were Catherine's, they were the
creditors' by rights. Mrs. John was not wise
enough to understand all that; but Hester, if she
knew, would understand. Catherine could not keep
her mind from dwelling upon these ornaments. If
Hester knew, what would the girl do? Pocket the
shame and continue to wear them as became Mrs.
John's daughter, or tear them from her neck and
trample them under foot? One or the other she
would have to do&mdash;but then, Hester did not know.</p>

<p>As she walked about through the rooms, stopping
to give a gracious word there, a nod here, a question
about father or mother, Catherine's mind was not
occupied either with the house or the company, but
with this girl. Hester had been in the background
till now. A glimpse of her in the corner of her own
drawing-room, standing by her mother's side in her
washed muslin, did not&mdash;though Hester's look was
always one of indignation&mdash;impress her relation's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
mind. But here she stood like an equal, sending
glances of defiance out of her brown eyes. Hester
had come in the old fly with the white horse, while
Emma was fetched from her grandfather's by Catherine's
carriage. The contrast was striking enough;
but Catherine, though she would not own it to
herself, was more aware than any one else, that
no one would look twice at Emma while Hester
was by.</p>

<p>When the evening was about half over, Emma
came to her patroness and kindly gave her her
dismissal.</p>

<p>"Don't wait longer on my account, Cousin Catherine,"
she said. "I am quite nicely started; thank
you so much. I have got my card filled; quite the
nicest people in the room have asked me. I'm sure
I am very grateful to you, for it is all your doing;
but don't think of waiting for me. Chaperons
are not at all wanted, and I can go home in Hester's
fly. I am so much obliged to you, but of course
you want to get to bed. Don't stay a moment
longer than you wish, for me."</p>

<p>Catherine smiled, but did not take any further
notice. She walked about the rooms for some time
after on the arm of Harry, who was always dutiful.</p>

<p>"And who do you think is the prettiest person
in the room, Harry? I excuse you from telling
me it is my young lady, whom for my own part I
don't admire."</p>

<p>"I cannot see there is any doubt about it, Aunt
Catherine," said Harry, in his sturdy way. "It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
my cousin Hester. There is an air about her&mdash;I
cannot explain it: I found it out long ago; but now
everybody sees it."</p>

<p>"Thanks to her mother's pearls," said Catherine,
with her laugh.</p>

<p>Harry looked at her with startled eyes.</p>

<p>"The pearls are very pretty on her; but they are
nothing, to me at least," he said.</p>

<p>"You should not let her wear them. She should
not have them; knowing her father's story, as I
suppose you do.&mdash;Don't you see," cried Catherine,
with sudden energy, "that she ought not to appear
in Redborough in those pearls?"</p>

<p>Emma had been standing near when this conversation
began, and she drew closer to listen, not with
any clandestine intention, but only with a natural
curiosity. She caught up the words in a disjointed
way. What reason could there be for not wearing
your mother's pearls? She would have gone and
asked the question direct of Catherine, but that just
then her partner came for her; and for the rest of
the evening she had no time to consider any such
question; nor was it till she found herself in the fly
in the middle of the night rumbling and jolting
along the dark road that skirted the Common, by
Hester's side, that this mysterious speech occurred
to her mind. She had been talking of the advantage
of being introduced by a well-known person and
thus put at once "on a right footing."</p>

<p>"You don't want that. You know everybody;
you have been here all your life," she said. "And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
I am sure you got plenty of partners, and looked
very nice. And what a pretty necklace that is,"
said Emma, artlessly entering upon her subject.
"Are they real? Oh, you must not be offended
with me, for I never had any nice ornaments. The
youngest never has any chance. If they are real,
I suppose they are worth a great deal of money;
and you must be quite rich, or you would not be
able to afford them."</p>

<p>"We are not rich; indeed we are very poor," said
Hester, "but the pearls are my mother's. She got
them when she was young, from her mother. They
have belonged to us for numbers of years."</p>

<p>"I wonder what Cousin Catherine could mean!"
said Emma innocently.</p>

<p>"About my pearls?" cried Hester, pricking up
her ears, and all her spirit awakening, though she
was so sleepy and tired of the long night.</p>

<p>"She said you oughtn't to wear them. She
said you shouldn't have them. I wonder what she
meant! And Mr. Harry Vernon, that tall gentleman,
he seemed to understand, for he got quite red
and angry."</p>

<p>"I oughtn't to wear them&mdash;I shouldn't have
them!" Hester repeated, in a blaze of wrath. She
sat bolt upright, though she had been lying back in
her corner indisposed for talk.</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say she didn't mean anything," said
Emma, "only spite, as you are on the other side."</p>

<p>Hester did not reply, but she was roused out of all
her sleepiness in a moment. She let Emma prattle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
on by her side without response. As they drove past
the Grange a window was opened softly, and some
one seemed to look out.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wonder if that was Mr. Edward," said
Emma. "I wonder why he stayed away. Is he
after some girl, and doesn't want Cousin Catherine
to know? If it were not that you would scarcely
speak to each other when you met, I should say it
was you, Hester."</p>

<p>"I wish," said Hester severely, "that you would
go to sleep; at three in the morning I never want
to talk."</p>

<p>"Well, of course, it may be that," said Emma
somewhat inconsequently, "but I never want to
sleep when I have been enjoying myself. I want
to have some one in the same room and to talk it
all over&mdash;everything that has happened. Who was
that man, do you know who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And here she went into details which Hester,
roused and angry, paid no attention to. But Emma
was not dependent on replies. She went on asking
questions, of which her companion took no notice,
till the fly suddenly stopped with a great jarring and
rattling, and the opening of two doors, and glimmers
of two small lights in the profound dark, gave note
of watchers in the two houses, warned by the slow
rumbling of the ancient vehicle, and glad to be
released from their respective vigils. In Hester's
case it was her mother, wrapped in a warm dressing-gown,
with a shawl over her head, and two anxious
eyes shining out with warm reflections over her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
little candle, who received the girl in her finery with
eager questions if she were very cold, if she were
tired, if all had gone off well.</p>

<p>"Run up stairs, my darling, while I fasten the
door," Mrs. John said. "There is a nice fire and
you can warm yourself&mdash;and some tea."</p>

<p>In those days people, especially women, were not
afraid of being kept awake because of a cup of tea.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Hester when her mother followed
her up stairs into the old-fashioned, low-roofed
room, which the fire filled with rosy light, "it
appears that Catherine Vernon says I ought not to
wear your pearls. Has she anything to do with
your pearls? Has she any right to interfere?"</p>

<p>"My pearls!" cried Mrs. John almost with a
scream. "What could Catherine Vernon have to
do with them? I think, dear, you must have fallen
asleep and been dreaming. Where have you seen
Catherine Vernon, Hester? She gives us our house,
dear; you know we are so far indebted to her: but
that is the only right she can have to interfere."</p>

<p>"Had she anything to do with my father?"
Hester asked.</p>

<p>She was relieved from she did not know what
indefinable terrors by the genuine astonishment in
her mother's face.</p>

<p>"Anything to do with him? Of course; she had
a great deal to do with him. She was his first
cousin. Her father had brought him up. It was
intended&mdash;&mdash;but then he met me," said the gentle
little woman, not without a tone of satisfaction in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the incoherent tale. "And she was a kind of
partner, and had a great deal to do with the bank.
I never understood the rights of it, Hester. I never
had any head for business. Wait, darling, till I
undo these buttons. And now, my love, if you have
got warm, go to bed. My pearls! She must mean,
I suppose, that they are too good for you to wear
because we are poor. They were my mother's, and
her mother's before that. I would like to know
what Catherine Vernon could have to say to them,"
Mrs. John said, taking the pearls from her child's
throat and holding them up, all warm and shining,
to the light, before she deposited them in their
carefully padded bed.</p>

<p>If there was anything in the world that was her
individual property, and in which no one else had
any share, it was her pearls: they had always been
one of her household gods.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<h3>A CENTRE OF LIFE.</h3>


<p>There are periods in life, and especially in the
early part of it, when all existence gets, as it
were, out of focus, and instead of some great and
worthy centre, takes to circling round some point of
outwardly frivolous meaning, some little axis of
society entirely unfit to be the turning-point of even
the smallest world of human concerns. This had
come to be the case with the Vernons in those
lingering weeks of winter just before Christmas.
That the young, gay, foolish&mdash;nay, absurd&mdash;house
on the hill inhabited by Algernon Merridew and his
wife should become to all of this important family
the chief place, not only in Redborough, but for
a time, in the world, was the most curious fact
imaginable; but yet it was so. To Edward it was
the one place in the world where he was, as he
hoped, free from observation and able to do as he
pleased; which meant&mdash;where he was entirely free
from Catherine, and need have no fear of any interruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
from her to his amusement, or his pleasure,
or, if you like it better, his love: to Hester it was
the place where she had been recognised as part
possessor in her own person, like the others, of the
honours due to her family, and where the homage,
to which a young woman sufficiently endowed has a
right, was first given to her; if it had a more close
attraction still as the place where she met Edward,
that was a dream as yet unacknowledged to her own
heart. Harry, on the other hand, had a double
interest&mdash;neither of them of a very cheerful kind&mdash;one
of which was the necessity of standing by his
sister, who his good sense told him was embarked in
a very perilous way, and whose husband was quite
incapable of controlling or guiding her erratic course;
and the other was the painful fascination of watching
Edward and Hester through all the vicissitudes
of their quarrellings and makings up&mdash;the hours
they would spend together, followed by other hours
in which they would mutually scowl at each other
and did not speak. Harry knew, poor fellow, by a
sort of instinct common to the rejected, that the
quarrels were as ominous, or more so, than the
intimacy. Hester had never quarrelled with himself,
they had been on the best terms, alas, as they
were now! But Edward she would pass with
flushed cheek and shining eye: she would address
him with haughty reluctance when it was necessary
to speak to him, and mark her reluctance with a
decision which was never employed towards those
for whom she cared nothing. Harry's eyes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
opened, and he understood the duel between them.
The only mistake he made was in the belief that it
had gone further than the preliminary stage. He
could not believe it possible that no explanation had
taken place between them.</p>

<p>And of all people to be interested in Ellen's silly
parties, who should be seized with an intense desire
to know all about them but Catherine Vernon herself?
She did know more about them than any one
else who was not present, and than a great many
who were present. Her suspicions had been roused
by various indications of something occult in
Edward's mind. He was no longer on his guard to
the incredible extent which had been common with
him; his mind was agitated with new hopes and
fears&mdash;the chance of being able to be altogether
independent of Catherine had made him relax in his
caution, and there had been moments when, in all
the stir and elation of his new life, he had been on
the eve of disclosing everything. Habitual prudence
had saved him, but yet there had been something
in his aspect which had roused Catherine's suspicions.
They had been, as she thought, in such
entire sympathy before, that she was deeply
affected by this feeling, which she could not explain
to herself&mdash;this sense of being in sympathy no
longer. And it was all since Ellen's absurd parties
began, and he began to meet at them, <i>that</i> girl, born
for the confusion of all her plans, Catherine thought.
There were evenings when the strongest temptation
to order her carriage instead of going to bed, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
go suddenly&mdash;unexpected&mdash;to Ellen's party, and see
with her own eyes what was going on, would come over
her mind. But there was in Catherine's mind, along
with her suspicions, that terror to have them confirmed,
which so often goes with love when it begins
to tremble in this way. Had she gone, Edward
would have declared contemptuously (within himself)
that it was all of a piece with her usual watchfulness,
and the perfection of her system&mdash;not being able to
divine that Catherine would have given the world to
find herself in the wrong, and shrank from proving
herself to be in the right. In the meantime she was
kept informed of what was going on more or less by
various people, and above all by Emma Ashton,
whose information, though largely leavened by a
great deal about herself which did not much interest
her hearer, also afforded revelations about other
people, especially Hester. Emma had become a
constant visitor at the Grange. She was allowed to
prattle for hours, and Catherine was always kind to
her. Her insignificance, her little egotisms, her
straightforward aim at her own advancement, did not
call forth the amused contempt of that observer of
the human comedy as they would have done in any
other specimen. Catherine's tradition in favour of
her mother's kindred covered this little person with
a shield. But those who were not aware of this fond
superstition wondered and scorned. And the feeling
of the Redborough community was not in Emma's
favour.</p>

<p>"She is just a horrid little spy," Ellen cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
"I know she goes and tells Aunt Catherine everything.
I shouldn't have her if I could help it; but
everybody knows now that she is Aunt Catherine's
relation, and they are all civil to her."</p>

<p>"She cannot do us any harm, Nelly," said her
husband, "we are not afraid of any spy, I hope."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk so much nonsense, Algy," cried
Ellen. "Of course she can't do us any harm; but
I hate spies for all that."</p>

<p>They were wrong so far that Emma was not at all
a spy. Of all the interminable discourses she poured
out upon Catherine, the far greater part was about
herself; only unfortunately the part that interested
her auditor was not that about herself, but the
much smaller portion in which, quite unconscious
and without any evil motive, she dropped here and
there a chance hint as to the others.</p>

<p>"And whom did you say Edward was dancing
with?" Catherine would say.</p>

<p>"Oh, I was not talking of Mr. Edward, but of
young Mr. Merridew, who is always very attentive.
That was our third dance together, and I did feel it
was a great pity there were no chaperons, because I
should have asked her, if I had been with any one,
whether it wasn't rather, you know&mdash;for I
wouldn't for the world do anything to get myself
talked about."</p>

<p>"I thought you had been talking about Edward,"
Catherine said.</p>

<p>"Oh dear no. It was whether three dances
together wasn't perhaps a little&mdash;&mdash; for I always feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the responsibility of belonging to the family, Cousin
Catherine, and I wouldn't for the world do anything&mdash;&mdash;it
is quite different with gentlemen. Mr.
Edward was just carrying on as usual."</p>

<p>"But, Emma, you must tell me what you mean
by 'carrying on.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean any harm," Emma would say.
"I wonder what young Mr. Merridew is&mdash;if he is
well off, and all that? Hester has cousins all round
to tell her what's best, and of course she does not
need to be on her p's and q's, like me."</p>

<p>Catherine had to follow a mazy, vague, and
wandering clue thus, through acres of indifferent
matter, and to piece together broken scraps of
information which were never intended to affect her
at all. But they did affect her sometimes so powerfully
that she had her hand actually on the bell, not
only that evening but on several other occasions, to
intimate that she should want the carriage at ten
o'clock&mdash;a proceeding which would have convulsed
the household at home, and carried consternation to
the recipients of the unlooked-for honour. But, on
further consideration, Catherine always succeeded in
subduing herself, often sadly enough saying to herself
that it would be time enough when he told her&mdash;Why
should she go out to meet trouble? Her heart
so took her strength from her, and changed her
natural temperament, that Catherine restrained
herself, with a shrinking, which nobody who knew
her would have believed in, from any contact with
irresistible fact, and decided that rather than find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
out the vanity of her confidence it was better to
be deceived.</p>

<p>Thus the house on the hill which flaunted forth
every Thursday evening the great lamps of its lighted
windows and the lines of Chinese lanterns in the
conservatory, became the centre for the moment of
a great deal of life and many anxious thoughts. It
turned Ellen's head with pride and delight when she
received indications of this, which indeed came to
her on all sides. When a shade of alarm crossed
Algernon's face at the amount of the bills, she took
a lofty position which no man pretending to any spirit
could have gone against. "Goodness, Algy, how
can you look so glum about a pound or two, when
you see we are doing a great work?" Ellen said.
"Well! if it is not more important than mothers'
meetings, I don't know what words mean: and
Mr. Ransom says the mothers' meetings are a great
work." Algernon laughed, but he, too, felt a thrill
of pride. To have made the house, which though
it was Ellen's was a Merridew house, and his own,
into a centre for the great Vernon family, was, if not
a great work, at least an extraordinary local success,
such as old Merridew's son could never have hoped
to attain to. And indeed Algernon's remonstrances
about the bills were of the feeblest description. He
was too much devoted to his wife to have interfered
with her, even had not the balance of moral force
been on her side; and he was proud of the extravagance
and the commotion and the way in which the
elders shook their heads. It is pleasant to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
sensation, and Algernon was comforted by the knowledge
that he had already made a little money by
his stockbroking transactions, and hoped to make a
great deal more.</p>

<p>The young men had carried on their transactions
with considerable vigour, though with little risk so far
as Algernon and Harry were concerned. But Edward's
was a different case. The venture upon which he
had pondered with so much anxiety had turned out
favourably, and he had gone on without telling his
secret to any one, with a general amount of success
which had made the operation of risking other
people's money seem quite natural to him&mdash;a process
without any practical consequences at all, except the
accumulation of a good deal of money under his
own name, which is one of the happiest of sensations.
To his temperament indeed it is by no means
certain that the vicissitudes of the career in which
he had embarked, the tragic suspense in which he
was occasionally held, and the transport of deliverance
that followed, were not in themselves the highest
pleasures of which he was capable. And even so
early in his career as this, such crises would come.
He had self-command enough not to betray himself
when these moments arrived, and though there were
eyes keen enough to see that something had produced
a change in him, they were, as has been seen
in Catherine's case, deceived as to the cause of his
perturbation. Hester did not have so many opportunities
of studying him, and she had no clue to the
business complications in which he was involved;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
but she had many thoughts on her own mind as to
the reason of all the commotion which she saw
vaguely, without understanding it. Some of the
members of the general society, strangers who sometimes
perceive a departure from habit which does
not strike the most intimate, had said of Edward
on more than one occasion, that he must be in love.
Was he in love? Hester had felt that a look was
directed to herself when this was said, and that a
suppressed laugh had run round the little group.
She was herself agitated by tumults which she could
not understand, commotions in which Edward was
certainly involved, and his name thus mentioned
brought the blood to her cheek. Was he in love?
She did not want to turn the question upon herself,
to bring the matter to any conclusion, one way or
another. He was very pale that evening, yet would
flush, as she herself did, growing red in a moment
and then pale again; and there was a watchful air
about him as of a man who expected to hear something
or see some one whom nobody else looked for.
A man who was in love did not behave so. He was
absorbed in the being whom he loved. He is not
absorbed in me, the girl said to herself involuntarily,
then blushed, as if her thought had been found out.
Edward came up to her at this moment, which made
her confusion the greater.</p>

<p>"Why do you change colour so? What is the
matter?" he said to her.</p>

<p>"It is you who are changing colour," said Hester,
not knowing how else to defend herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of contradicting her, or throwing off the
accusation, he suddenly took her hand and drew it
through his arm.</p>

<p>"It is true," he said. "I have something on my
mind. You were going to dance this waltz with
me. Come into the hall, it is cool there, and let
us talk instead?"</p>

<p>Every inch of available space in the house was
given up to the accommodation of the guests, and
the hall was filled, like the conservatory, with plants,
among which little groups of two could find corners.
Edward established Hester in one of these, and
placed a chair for himself, so as to cut her off
from everybody.</p>

<p>"You are the only one that can understand," he
said. "I can speak to you. Don't mind me if I
look like a fool. I am too anxious to talk."</p>

<p>"What is it?" she said, with a tremour of sympathetic
anxiety.</p>

<p>"It is only business," he said, "but it is business
so unexpected that even beside you I am obliged to
think of it. Can a man say more than that?" he
asked with something in his eyes which Hester had
never seen there so distinctly before, and which
silenced her. One great emotion clears the way for
another. Edward in the commotion of his being was
almost ready to rush into words that, being said,
would have turned his life upside down, and shattered
all his present foundations. He was saved by
an incident which was of the most ordinary commonplace
kind. There came a violent ring at the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
which was within half a dozen steps of the spot
where they sat. Half a dozen heads immediately
protruded from among the little banks of foliage to
see what this odd interruption could mean, for all the
guests had arrived, and it was not late enough for
any one to go away. Hester saw that all the colour
ebbed immediately out of Edward's face. He did not
even attempt to say a word to her, but sat perfectly
still, slightly turned towards the door, but not looking
out, awaiting whatever might come. It seemed to
Hester that never in her life had she so understood
the power of fate, the moment when Nature and life
seem to stand still before some event. A minute
after, the footman came up and handed a telegram to
Edward. He tore it open with trembling hands. The
next moment he jumped up from his seat with a
suppressed cry of triumph. "Hurrah!" he said, and
then with a laugh which was very unsteady held out
the despatch to her. All that it contained were the
words "All right." But somehow it was not to these
words that Hester's eyes confined themselves. "From
Ashton, London&mdash;&mdash;" she said without knowing that
she did so, before he thrust the pink paper into his
pocket. "Come along," he said, "the waltz is not
half over. We shall be in time yet." And for the rest
of the evening Edward was in wild spirits, dancing
every dance. He even asked the girls to take him
with them in their fly as far as the Grange in his
reckless exhilaration, and as he got out in the darkness,
Hester felt a kiss upon her hand. This startled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
her still more than the telegram. "Till to-morrow,"
he said as they rumbled away.</p>

<p>"What does he mean by till to-morrow? He must be
coming to make you an offer to-morrow&mdash;that is how
they do. It often happens after a dance&mdash;when it is
going to happen," Emma said in the darkness, with a
little sigh.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<h3>WAS IT LOVE?</h3>


<p>Was he in love? That this was a question very
interesting to Hester there can be no reason to conceal.
She did not even conceal it from herself, nor
did she trifle with herself by pretending to suppose
that if he were in love it could be with any one else.
There was no one else who had ever appeared to
attract him. To nobody had he so much as given his
passing attention. When he had neglected her at the
Grange it had been truly, as he said, for no higher
reason than that he might hand down the old ladies
to supper or tea. No young one had ever been
suggested as having any attraction for him. Hester
did her best to enter calmly into this question. It is
one which it is sometimes very difficult for a young
woman to decide upon. What is conspicuous and
apparent to others will often remain to her a question
full of doubt and uncertainty; and it is to be feared
that when this is the case it is all the more likely that
her own sentiments will be capable of very little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
question. This, however, was not exactly the case
with Hester. Her mind was very much interested, and
indeed excited. She wanted to know what Edward
meant. From the first morning when he had met her,
a child wandering on the Common, his manner had
been different to her from the manner of other people,
or from his own manner to others. His eyes had
lingered upon her with pleasure even when his look
had been stealthy; even when it had been but a glance
in passing, they had said things to her which no other
eyes said. His interest in her had never failed. It
had not leaped like Harry's, after a good deal of
indifference, into a sudden outburst. The very charm
and attraction of it had lain in the restraint which
Hester had often considered to be dishonest, and
against which she had chafed. She had known all
through, even in those evenings when he had neglected
her, that he was always conscious what she was
doing, and knew without looking when any one went
to talk to her, when she left the room and when she
came back. This had kept her own interest in him
unvarying. But Hester was not any more sure of
her own sentiments than of his. She remembered
with some shame that Roland Ashton's presence had
made a great difference in the state of her mind as
regarded Edward. She had felt but little curiosity
about him when that stranger was at the Vernonry.
All the foreground of her mind had been so pleasantly
occupied by that new figure which was in itself much
more attractive than Edward, that he had slid almost
completely out of her thoughts. And this fact, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
was only quite apparent to her after Roland was
gone, had greatly discomfited Hester, and given her
a very small opinion of herself. Was it possible that
any new object that might appear would have the
same effect upon her? The effect had passed away
and Edward had come slowly back to his original
position as the person who in all Redborough interested
her most. But the incident had been of a very
disturbing character, and had altogether confused
her ideas. Therefore the question was one of a very
special interest. To know exactly how he regarded
her would much help her in deciding the other question,
not less important, which was, how she regarded
him? Everything thus depended, Hester felt, on
Edward's sentiments. If it should turn out that he
loved her&mdash;strange thought which made her heart
beat!&mdash;it could not be but that in great and
tender gratitude for such a gift she should love him.
She did feel offended by his efforts to disguise his
feelings, or even to get the better of them&mdash;never at
least when she was cool and in command of her
judgment; but there could be no doubt that she
was very curious and anxious to know.</p>

<p>Was he in love? The appearances which had made
the lookers-on say so were not altogether to be attributed
to this, Hester knew. His paleness, his excitement,
his absence of mind, had all been from another
cause. The discovery had startled her much, and
given her an uneasy sense that she might at other
times have referred to some cause connected with
herself manifestations of feeling which had nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
to do with her, which belonged to an entirely different
order of sentiments&mdash;a thought which made her blush
red with shame, since there is nothing that hurts a
girl's pride so much as the suggestion, that she has
been vain, and imagined, like the foolish women, a
man to love her who perhaps has never thought of
her at all. But the question altogether was one which
was too profound for Hester. She could not tell
what to make of it. Among the heads of the young
party at the Merridews, she was aware that no doubt
was entertained on the matter. Edward was allotted
to her by a sort of unspoken right, and in Ellen's jibes
and Harry's gloom she read alike the same distinct
understanding. Ellen in her chatter, notwithstanding
the warning to her cousin at the beginning, accepted
it entirely as a matter of course: and in a hundred
things that Edward had said as well as in his looks,
which were still more eloquent, there had been strong
confirmation of the general belief. But yet&mdash;Hester
could not make up her mind that it was beyond
doubt. She watched him, not with anxiety so much
as with a great curiosity. If it was not so, would
she be deeply disappointed? she asked herself without
being able even to answer that question. And
as to her own sentiments, they were quite as perplexing.
She was half ashamed to feel that they
depended upon his. Was this a confession of feminine
inferiority? she sometimes wondered with a hot
blush&mdash;the position here being very perplexing
indeed and profoundly difficult to elucidate; for it
neither consisted with the girl's dignity to give her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
love unsought, nor thus to wait as if ready to deliver
up her affections to the first bidder.</p>

<p>Such a matter of thought, involving the greatest
interests of life, is curiously mixed up with its most
frivolous events. They met in the midst of the
dancing with a constant crash and accompaniment of
dance-music, amid chatterings and laughter, and all
the inane nothings of a ball-room, and yet in the
midst of this were to consider and decide the most
important question of their lives. It was only thus,
except by concerted meetings which would have
solved the question, that they could meet at all, and
the grotesque incongruity of such surroundings with
the matter in the foreground, sometimes affected
Hester with a sort of moral sickness and disgust.
The scene seemed to throw a certain unworthiness,
levity, unelevated aspect upon the question altogether&mdash;as
if this thing which was to affect two lives was
no more than an engagement for a dance.</p>

<p>And though it is a strange thing to say, it is
doubtful whether Edward was much more decided
in his sentiments than Hester was. In such a case
the man at least generally knows more or less what
he wants; but partly because Edward's mind was in
a high state of excitement on other subjects, he too
was for a moment entirely uncertain as to what his
wishes were. He knew with sufficient distinctness
that he could not tolerate the idea of her appropriation
by any one else, and it was his full intention
that some time or other Hester should be his, and
no one else's, which gave a foundation of certainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
to his thoughts which was wanting to hers. But
further than this, he too was in a chaos somewhat
similar to that of Hester. Sometimes there was in
his mind the strongest impulse to tell her that he
loved her, and to settle the matter by an engagement,
which must, however, he felt, be a secret one,
giving satisfaction to themselves but no one else.
And here it may be remarked that whereas Hester
was apt to be seized by sudden fits of shame at the
idea that perhaps, after all her thoughts on the
subject, he was not thinking of her at all, Edward
on the other hand felt no such alarm, and never
thought it even presumptuous on his part to assume
the certainty of her love for him, which, as the
reader knows, was a certainty to which she had not
herself attained. He believed with simplicity that
when, if ever (nay, certainly it was to happen some
time), he declared himself, Hester would respond
at once. He acknowledged to himself that it was
possible that in pique, or impatience, or weariness,
if he did not keep a vigilant watch over the situation,
it might happen that Hester would accept
some one else. Her mother might drive her to
it, or the impossibility of going on longer might
drive her to it; but he had so much confidence in
the simplicity of her nature that he did not believe
that the complications which held him in on every
side could affect her, and was sure that in her heart
the question was solved in the most primitive way.</p>

<p>This was and generally is the great difference
between the man and woman in such a controversy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
until he had spoken, it was a shame to her that she
should ask herself did he intend to speak; but
Edward felt no shame if ever the idea crossed his
mind that he might be mistaken in supposing she
loved him; such a discovery would have made him
furious. He would have aimed all sorts of ill names,
such as coquette and jilt, at her; but he had no
fear of any such mistake. He felt sure that he had
her in his power, and when he did declare himself
would be received with enthusiasm; and he always
meant to declare himself some time, to reward her
long suspense, and to make her the happiest of
women. In words, this part is generally allotted to
the lady, as it was in the days of chivalry. But the
nineteenth century has modified many things, and if
ever (out of America) it was really the woman who
occupied the more commanding position, it is no
longer so in the apprehension of the world. Only
in this particular case, as has been seen, Edward was
wrong. It is possible enough that in the curious
position of affairs between them she would have
followed his lead whatever it might be; but even
this was by no means certain, and as a matter of
fact, though her curiosity about him drew her mind
after him, she had not even gone so far as he had,
nor come to any ultimate certainty on the case
at all.</p>

<p>Emma Ashton, who by means of propinquity&mdash;that
quick knitter of bonds&mdash;had become Hester's
frequent companion, had very different ideas on a
similar subject. There was no sort of indefiniteness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
in her views. She was perfectly clear as to what
she was likely to do in a given case, and the case in
question occupied probably almost as great a share
in her thoughts as the different yet similar question
which agitated the mind of Hester. It was indeed
to outward view, though with so many and subtle
differences, a very similar question. Emma's
wonder was whether Reginald Merridew would
"speak" before she went away. She had no doubt
that all the requisite sentiments were existing, and
she had satisfied herself that when he did "speak"
there was no reason why she should not reply
favourably. The family was "quite respectable,"
it might almost be said also that it was "quite
well off," but that there were rumours that Algernon
was to be "made an eldest son of," which were
somewhat disquieting. The suggestion was one
which made Emma indignant, notwithstanding the
gratitude she owed Algernon and his wife for giving
her "her chance" in Redborough.</p>

<p>"When there is an estate I suppose it is all right,"
Emma said; "anyhow it can't be helped when that's
the case; and there must be an eldest son. But
when your property is in money it does seem such a
mistake to make a difference between your children.
Don't you think so? Oh, but I do; they are just one
as good as another, and why should one be rich and
another poor? If old Mr. Merridew does anything
of this sort I am sure I shall always think it is
very unfair."</p>

<p>"I suppose Mr. Merridew has a right to do what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
he pleases?" said Hester; "and as it does not matter
to us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You speak a great deal too fast," said Emma,
offended. "Say it doesn't matter to you: but it
may to me a great deal, and therefore I take a
great interest in it. Do you think parents have a
right to do what they please? If they make us
come into the world, whether we wish it or not, of
course they are bound to do their best for us. I am
the youngest myself, and I hope I know my place;
but then there was no money at all among us. Papa
spent it all himself; so certainly we had share and
share alike, for there was nothing. When that's
the case nobody can have a word to say. But the
Merridews have a good deal, and every one ought to
have his just share. Not but what I like Algernon
Merridew very much. He is always very agreeable,
and I think it very nice both of Ellen and him that
they should have been so kind to me and given me
my chance, though you say we're no relations. I
am sure I always thought we were relations, for
my part."</p>

<p>"Did you think Reginald was your relation too?"</p>

<p>"Well, not perhaps quite so far as that&mdash;a connection
I should have said; but it does not matter very
much now," Emma said, with a little simper of
satisfaction. "What a good thing Roland found out
about grandpapa and grandmamma, Hester&mdash;and how
fortunate that they should have asked <i>me</i>! If everything
goes right I shall feel that I owe the happiness
of my life to it. When a girl goes out upon a visit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
she never knows what may happen before she gets
home&mdash;or even she may never need to go home at
all. I don't know if I shall, I am sure. To talk
about anything taking place from Roland's house
would be absurd. Why, we don't even know the
clergyman! and nobody cares a bit about us. If there
was any meaning in home it should be from Elinor's,
you know&mdash;for everybody knows us there."</p>

<p>"What do you mean about 'anything taking
place'?&mdash;and from&mdash;from what?" Hester asked, who
never paid too much attention to Emma's monologues,
and had altogether lost the thread of her
discoursings now.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Emma, clasping Hester's arm close,
"how you do make one blush! Of course you know
very well what I mean. If he speaks before I go
away&mdash;and I am sure I hope he will, for it would be
such a nuisance to have him following me up to
Kilburn!&mdash;I don't suppose there would be any
occasion for waiting long. Why should people
wait when they are well off enough, and nothing
to be gained by it? When the man has not
got settled in a proper situation, or when there
is not enough to live upon, then of course they
must put it off; but in such a case as ours&mdash;I
mean this, you know&mdash;it might as well be here
as anywhere," Emma said, reflectively. "Cousin
Catherine has always been very kind to me. Rather
than let grandpapa and grandmamma be disturbed
at their age, I shouldn't wonder if she would give
the breakfast&mdash;especially considering the double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
connection, and that it is such a very good thing to
get me settled. You needn't laugh, Hester. It is
not a thing to laugh at. Unless I had settled, what
should I have done? You are an only daughter,
you don't know what it is to be the youngest and
have no proper home."</p>

<p>These words mollified Hester, who had been in
lofty opposition, half disgusted, half indignant. She
was brought down by this appeal to her sympathy.
"But you are happy with your brother?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;happy enough; Roland is very kind.
And though it's a small house, it is tolerably nice,
and two maids with nothing particular to do. But
it is very dull, you know, and I don't know many
people. And you must always take into consideration
that at any moment Roland might marry, and
then where should I be? Why, he admires you
very much. He might just as likely as not, next
time he comes, make you an offer; and then where
should I be?"</p>

<p>"You think, I suppose," said Hester, loftily, "that
when a man makes an offer, as you say, that is all
about it; there is no opposition to be looked for on
the girl's side?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know," said Emma, "I call you one of
the high-flown ones. There are always some like that.
But in an ordinary way what do girls want but their
chance? And when they've got it, what folly to
refuse&mdash;at least in my position, Hester. If I don't
get settled, what have I to look forward to? Roland
will marry sooner or later. He's an awful flirt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
though he admires you very much, I shouldn't advise
you to have anything to do with him unless you just
marry him out and out. I should think he'd make
a good husband. But don't be engaged to him,
Hester; mind my words. Be married in three weeks,
or have nothing to say to him&mdash;that is my advice.
Oh, you need not be huffy. I am sure I don't want
you or any one to marry him, at least till I am
settled. But if I don't settle now, he is sure, of
course, to marry some time; and then where shall I
be? This is what makes me wish that if&mdash;<i>he</i>, you
know, is going to speak, he would do it, and not
shilly-shally. It is astonishing how men shilly-shally.
I think they take a pleasure in it. They would
know better if they had to wait as we have, and
wonder, and feel that we can't make any arrangements
or settle anything till we know what's coming.
If I have to go away and he never says anything, I
don't know what I shall do."</p>

<p>"Is this because you&mdash;care so much for Reginald
Merridew?" Hester could not so form her lips as to
say love.</p>

<p>Emma made a sort of reflective pause. "I like
him well enough," she said. "I am not one to go
on about love and so forth. Besides, that sort of
thing is not becoming in a girl. You can't, till you
are quite certain what <i>they</i> mean, don't you know?
It is dreadful to go caring for them, and all that, and
then to find out that they don't care for you. A girl
has to wait till they speak."</p>

<p>Hester listened not with her usual mixture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
amusement and indignation, but with a curious feeling
of shame and alarm growing in her. Was not
this what she herself was doing? Emma's desire
that her supposed lover should speak and settle the
question, was it not much the same thing as her own
curiosity and self-questioning in respect to Edward?
Emma was always more practical. She was so in
sentimental matters as well as in everything else.
Things that other people leave indistinct, in a half
light, she put clearly, without any pretences at
obscurity. Her grieved sense of the shilly-shallying
of men, her consciousness of all the inconveniences
that arose from their way of putting off their explanations,
her prudential conviction that a girl should
not commit herself by "caring for" <i>them</i>, before
they made it apparent that they cared for her&mdash;were
these not so many vulgar, straightforward statements
of the dilemma in which Hester too found herself?
But this grotesque resemblance of sentiment and
situation made Hester, as may be supposed, passionately
angry and indignant, not with Emma, who
was guiltless, and who pursued the subject endlessly,
never tiring of it, nor of going over the matter again
and again from the beginning as they walked, but
with herself and Edward, and fate, which had placed
her in such circumstances. It was something like a
caricature of herself that was thus presented to her,
and she could scarcely help laughing at it, even while
she resented it warmly as an insult offered to her
by&mdash;whom? not Emma&mdash;by circumstances and
evil fortune, and the spite of a position which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
intolerable, and Catherine Vernon. All these persons
were conspiring against her, but none of them were
so hard upon Hester as this little purring deliberate
Emma, holding up her little distorted mirror that
Hester in her pride might see how like was the image
in it to her own troubled face.</p>

<h3>CHRISTMAS.</h3>


<p>While all these agitations were going on, it came
to be Christmas, with the usual stir and commotion
always produced in a large family and connections,
by that often troublesome festival. The amount of
reality in the rejoicings may be very doubtful, but
yet there must be a family gathering, and the
different branches of the race must seem to take
kindly to it whatever may be their private sentiments.
Dickens did wisely in finding his types of
Christmas felicity among people to whom an accidental
turkey is a benediction from heaven, and the
mystery of the pudding has not lost its freshness.
In such a family as the Vernons, the turkey and
the pudding are unsatisfactory symbols&mdash;a return
to the rude elements of plenty which were employed
by a more primitive age; and though it certainly
was an excitement for the Miss Vernon-Ridgways,
and Mr. Mildmay Vernon and Mrs. John, to be invited
to dinner, it was by no means invariable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
their feast improved the harmony of these much
separated divisions of the family. It was a very big
dinner, and there was no absolute breach of the
peace. Catherine sat at the head of the table in
a dress which, though very handsome, was by no
means one of her best, and without the diamonds in
which she appeared on very great occasions. This
was kindly intended, in order that she might not
make too evident the contrast between her own
toilette and that of some of her visitors; but the
kindness of the intention was not appreciated.</p>

<p>"We are not considered worth dressing for," Miss
Matilda said, in her sister's ear, after they had respectively
kissed their relative, and, with effusion,
wished her a merry Christmas.</p>

<p>"She thinks it better taste to be as shabby as we
are," said the other, which indeed was very true,
though no offence was meant.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. John, though she was quite willing to
enjoy herself, her mind was kept in a state of nervous
anxiety about Hester, who was in the defiant
mood with which she always met her cousin. It had
been her mother's desire to dress her plainly in one
of the simple dresses made up on the foundation of
the "silk slip," which by this time had been worn
out as a ball-dress. These economies were very
necessary, and indeed it ought to be said that the
ball-dresses could not have been kept up as they
were, but for the sacrifice of Mrs. John's Indian
shawl, which, after Hester and the pearls, was the
thing in the world which the poor lady held most dear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>Hester had not resisted the substitution of the
simpler dress for those carefully preserved clouds of
tarlatan which were sacred to the Dancing Teas.
But she stood firm to the pearls, and insisted on
wearing them. "Unless you will put them on
yourself, mamma," she said.</p>

<p>"I wear them, Hester! Oh, no! They have
been in their box all these years, and I have never
put them on, you know. I kept them for you. But
don't you think, dear, that just for a family dinner&mdash;no
one is expected to be fine at a family dinner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you want Catherine Vernon to see them,
mother? If it is so, tell me at once."</p>

<p>"Don't I want Catherine Vernon&mdash;to see them?"
cried Mrs. John, stupefied with astonishment. "I
wonder," she added, regretfully, "what there is
between you that makes you lose your good sense,
Hester&mdash;for you are very sensible in most things,
and far cleverer than I ever was&mdash;the moment
Catherine Vernon's name is mentioned? I cannot
think what it can be."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother! You are too good&mdash;if that is what
not being clever means. When I think how you
have been allowed to stand in the corner of that
room, and nobody taking any notice of you."</p>

<p>"My dear," said Mrs. John, mildly, "I did not
require to go unless I liked."</p>

<p>"And now this dinner&mdash;a sort of Christmas dole
for her relations&mdash;like the flannel petticoats to the
poor women."</p>

<p>"We do not require to go unless we like," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Mrs. John; "but if you will reflect a little, Hester,
that is not how a lady should talk."</p>

<p>It was seldom that the mild little woman said so
much. When Hester came up to Catherine, following
her mother's little figure, clothed in a black silk
gown which had seen a great deal of service, she
read, with an excitement that made her glow, that
Catherine's first glance was upon the pearls.</p>

<p>"You are quite fine," she said as she went through
the Christmas formula, and dropped a formal kiss
upon Hester's reluctant cheek; "you have put on
your lovely pearls to do us honour."</p>

<p>"She is fond of the pearls," said Mrs. John, who
was very watchful to prevent any collision; "they
were her grandmother's, and her great-grandmother's,
Catherine. It is not only for their value that one
is fond of things like these."</p>

<p>"Their value is sometimes the worst thing about
them," said Catherine, feeling that there was a sternness
of virtue in what she said which justified her
dislike. But Mrs. John stood her ground.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," she said simply. "I like them to
be worth a great deal, for they are all she will have."</p>

<p>Hester, thus talked over, stood drawing back, in
all her flush of youthful indignation, kept down
by the necessities of the occasion. She gave a
glance round at the little audience which was enjoying
the encounter, the Miss Vernon-Ridgways in
the foreground. She caught their keen inquisitive
stare, and the mantling of delight upon their faces
as they witnessed the little passage of arms; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Mr. Vernon Mildmay craning over their shoulders
with his sharp face projected to see what it was, and
Mrs. Reginald's countenance half sympathetic, half-preoccupied
(for to-day for the first time her eldest
boy had accompanied her, and she was very anxious
lest he should do or say anything that might injure
him with Catherine). But the one thing Hester did
not catch was Edward's eyes, which surely, if he had
cared for her, ought now to have been raised in
kindness. He was outside of the circle, his head
turned away, taking no notice. When Mrs. John
fell back to give way to Ellen Merridew, who came
up rustling and jingling with all her bracelets,
Edward still kept apart. He was talking to Harry,
to Algernon, to everybody except the two who,
Hester felt, wanted the succour of a chivalrous sympathy.
But Mrs. John had no feeling of this kind.
She felt that she had held her own. She looked
with a mild pride upon the group of her neighbours
all so eagerly watching for mischief. It was natural,
when you think of it, that she should treat the
ill-nature of the Miss Vernon-Ridgways with gentle
disdain. Poor things! they had neither a daughter
nor a necklace of pearls. And as she had not been
at the <i>Th&eacute;s dansantes</i>, nor seen Edward in any aspect
but that he had always borne at the Grange, she
felt no anxiety as to his present behaviour. Harry's
was the eye which she sought. She beamed with
smiles when he came and stood beside her. Harry
was always faithful, whoever might be careless. She
looked at him and at Hester with a little sigh; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
who could tell what might happen with patience
and time?</p>

<p>There was, however, one moment during the
evening in which Edward had the opportunity of
setting himself right. It was while the departures
were going on, while the ladies were being shawled
and cloaked. Catherine had not come down stairs,
and in the darkness of the further corner of the
hall, under cover of the chatter of Ellen and Emma
Ashton, the young man ventured upon a hurried
whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you despise me or detest me most?" he said
in Hester's ear. She started&mdash;what with the sudden
proximity, what with the unexpected character of
the question.</p>

<p>"I wonder?" she answered coldly. He took the
opportunity of wrapping her cloak round her to grasp
both her hands in a sudden, almost fierce grasp.</p>

<p>"You could do nothing less: but I cannot be
different here. Suspicion produces treachery, don't
you know?" he said, with his face close to her ear.
"I cannot be true here. No, don't say anything.
I ought, but I cannot. It is in the air. All of us,
every one except you, we are making believe and
finding each other out, yet going on all the same.
But it is only for a time," Edward cried, grasping
her hands once more till the pressure was painful,
"only for a time!"</p>

<p>Next moment he was standing at the door, impassible,
saying good-night to every one, paying no
more heed to Hester than if she had been, as indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
she was, the least important of all the Christmas
visitors. Ellen, as a married woman and a social
power, commanded his attention, and to Emma, as
the stranger among so many who knew each other,
he was very polite. But Hester got from him the
coolest good-night. The very servants who stood
about, felt a passing wonder that the prettiest person
in the company should meet with such scant observation,
but explained it by saying to each other that
"Mr. Edward, he was the one as kep' hold of the
main chance."</p>

<p>And Hester went home, angry, yet somewhat
soothed. It did not make her less indignant, less
wrathful; but it gave an excuse which at least had
to be taken into consideration. Before she got
home, indeed, she taught herself to lay that offence
too to the score of Catherine. She went home
packed into the fly with her mother and Emma and
the Miss Vernon-Ridgways, all together. Mr. Mildmay
Vernon was mounted on the box, and the old white
horse had the six people, besides his driver, to drag
behind him. He took a great deal of time over the
short bit of road, thinking probably that it was as
well to take his time over one fare as to put it in
the power of his oppressors to send him out with
another, or perhaps compel him to kick his heels
at the railway station waiting for the last train.
The ladies were packed very close inside, but not
too close to talk. The sisters immediately plunged
into that "criticism of life" which could scarcely be
called poetry, in their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a blessing it is," said one, "that we can't
be called upon to eat another Christmas dinner with
Catherine for another year."</p>

<p>"Dear Catherine!" said the other, "she always
means so well. It is our own fault if we don't
carry out her intentions."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Mrs. John, "she gave us a very
nice dinner, and everything was very comfortable."</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. John! you are always so charitable,"
said Miss Matilda, "as we all ought to be, I am
sure. Did you ever see anything so insufferable
as that little Ellen&mdash;like a picture out of a fashion-book&mdash;giving
herself as many airs as if she were
at the head of society? I never heard she had
any society, except the vulgar young people on
the Thursdays. I wonder she doesn't ask her shop
people."</p>

<p>"Oh, hush, hush!" cried Mrs. John, alarmed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she does ask the shop people," said Miss
Matilda, "it would be wise of her, for I should not
think they'd ever see the colour of their money.
The old Merridews can never keep up all that extravagance,
and Algy is nothing more than a clerk
in his father's office. It is dreadful to see a young
man dragged on to destruction like that."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope it is not so bad!" cried Mrs. John.
"I am sure if I thought so, I should never let&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is the talk of the town," said Miss Matilda.
"A thing must be very bad before it comes to us,
who never hear any gossip."</p>

<p>"Oh, everybody knows," said Miss Martha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>It was happy that Hester's mind was so fully
occupied, and that the conversation passed harmlessly
over her head. When they reached the
Vernonry, Mr. Mildmay Vernon got down from the
box where he had been seated wrapped up from
head to foot, but which he protested against with a
continuous volley of short coughs as he helped the
ladies out one after another. He thought in his
heart that if one of these strong young women had
been put up on the box, who had no rheumatism,
it would have been more appropriate.</p>

<p>"I hope you have enjoyed your evening, including
your dinner," he said. "I have made up my mind
to rheumatism to-morrow; but what does that
matter in comparison with such a delightful entertainment?"</p>

<p>"It was very nice," said Mrs. John, dubious as to
his meaning, as she always was.</p>

<p>"Nice!" he said, with a grimace, "a sort of little
heaven on earth!"</p>

<p>"It is wicked to be so satirical," said one sister,
with a laugh; and "Dear Catherine! I am sure she
meant everything that was kind," said the other.</p>

<p>And then there was a little flutter of good-nights,
the respective doors opening, and lights flashing out
into the dark.</p>

<p>This entertainment was followed very shortly after
by the larger gathering which Catherine had announced
her intention of giving some time before,
and to which all Redborough was convoked besides
the immediate family. The period between these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
two parties was the climax of Hester's hostility to
Catherine Vernon. She had never been so actively
indignant, so angry, nor so impotent against her old
and wealthy cousin as in these wintry days. Catherine
was a kind of impersonation of injustice and unkindness
to Hester. She felt not only that she herself
was oppressed and injured, but that the persecution
of which she was the object was of a kind which
was most petty and miserable, degrading to the
author of it as well as to its victim. The attempt
at interference with her movements was not only a
kind of meddling most irritating to a high-spirited
girl, but it was also the kind of assault which her
very pride prevented her from resisting openly.
Hester felt that she would have lowered her own
pride, and wounded her own self-respect, had she
uttered a word of reply or taken any notice of the
small and petty attack upon her. The incident of
the pearls, though so trifling, excited her almost as
much as the other and more important grievance she
had against Catherine. That Edward should be so
cowed by this woman that he had to conceal his
real sentiments, to offend the girl whom he loved,
to compromise his own honour and dignity all
because of Catherine's watch upon him, and the
subjection in which it held him, was such a miserable
thought to Hester, that it was all she could do
to restrain herself at all. It is terrible to be compelled
to endure one who has harmed those who are
dear to you; but to enter her house and preserve a
show of peace and good-feeling, though you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
aware she is causing the self-debasement of those
you love, that is the hardest of all. What should
it matter to Edward that Catherine's eye was upon
him? An honourable and fine spirit would not
have been influenced by any such oppression. It
made Hester's heart sick to think that he did this
consciously, deceived his benefactress, and pretended
to obey her when in his heart he loathed his
bondage; and to think that she herself should be
called upon to sustain this humiliation filled her
with shame and rage. But though her heart was
bitter against Edward, there was yet a softening in
it, an involuntary indulgence, which made her glad
to elude the question so far as he was concerned, and
to fix upon Catherine, who was the cause of it, with
all her force of indignation.</p>

<p>From Hester's point of view there was indeed
little to be said for this woman, who, to so many in
the place, was the very impersonation of active
benevolence and goodness&mdash;a tyrant who seized
upon the very soul of the young man whom she
favoured most, and whose prying and vigilant observation
forced him to deception, and made him
true to himself only when he was out of her sight&mdash;a
woman, who while she gave with one hand
closed a grasp of iron upon the people obliged to
her with the other, and would prescribe their very
dress if she could. Oh, how true it must be after
all, the picture of the tyrannical, narrow despot,
exacting, remorseless, descending to the lowest
details, which a woman, when endued with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
irresponsible power, was understood to make! Hester
had rebelled as a girl does against every such injurious
picture of women; but it occurred to her
now that it must all be true. No doubt it was
unsafe to trust such a creature with any kind of
authority. She would not be content with less than
absolute sway. She would let no charity nor ruth,
nor the hearts of others, nor their wishes, stand in
her way. She would crush a young life with no
more compunction than a savage. Thus Hester
took refuge from questions more trying&mdash;from the
aspect of Edward which within these last few days
had become more and more important to her. Her
whole being seemed to be flowing towards him with
a current which she felt herself unable to restrain.
She did not any longer ask herself questions about
his love. She tried not to ask any questions about
him at all. In her secret consciousness there was a
distrust of him, and disapproval and fear, which had
never been breathed into any ear&mdash;scarcely even into
her own. Indeed, Hester was her own only confidant.
All the things which occupied her were uncommunicable.
She had grown a woman, everything that
happened was now more important to her than in
earlier days. And now there had come a crisis in
her fate, and it was not she who held the key of the
problem, nor her lover, nor any legitimate authority&mdash;but
Catherine! Catherine controlled her future
and all its issues through him. Catherine could have
stopped all further development for both, she could
have checked their love ruthlessly, and made an end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
of their happiness. The girl began to feel that there
was something in the presence of this woman, in her
influence, in her very name, that was insupportable.
That impulse of flight which always presents itself to
the impatient spirit came upon her strongly. Why
should not she and her mother shake themselves free
from the imbroglio&mdash;go away anywhere, it did not
matter where, and get peace, at least, and a life free
of agitations and complications? Away from the
Vernons she would be free to work as she pleased,
and so make up for the aid that Catherine gave&mdash;away
from them there would be no more question of
love and hate, love afraid to declare itself, hate
veiled beneath the aspect of benevolence.</p>

<p>Hester had very little to do at home. She had
not even books to read. She had unbounded time to
think; even her visits to her old friends, the captain
and his wife, had grown less frequent since Emma
came, for Emma's monologues were not amusing to
Hester's excited mind, and the captain and Mrs.
Morgan had both yielded to their granddaughter's
irrepressible talent of speech. Hester was more at
home in consequence, more alone, less subject to
wholesome distractions and interruptions. She would
think and think the whole evening through. The
<i>Th&eacute;s dansantes</i> began to fill her with a sort of sickening,
of weariness, and disgust. She felt as if she too,
like Emma, had gone to get her "chance" there, and
was, like Emma, hung up in degrading suspense until
he should speak. The rage with her position, the scorn
of herself with which this filled her, is indescribable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
She would burst forth into wild laughter after one of
Emma's calculations, often repeated, about Reginald
Merridew; then hide her face in her hands to conceal
the burning blush&mdash;the bitter consciousness
that her own circumstances were not much different.
The self-ridicule was more painful still than the
self-disgust. She shed no tears over the question,
but the laughter was a great deal more bitter than
any tears.</p>

<p>Mrs. John was as unconscious of this struggle as if
it had gone on in Kamschatka and not under her
own eye, in her own parlour, and the bedroom that
opened into hers. She was not one of the women
who divine. She understood what was told her, and
not always that&mdash;never anything more than was told
her. She thought her child was not looking well,
but then, she had a cold; and there is nothing more
oppressive than a cold. The first thing that really
startled her was Hester's determination not to go to
Mrs. Merridew's party on the first Thursday that
occurred after Christmas, which was to be a particularly
brilliant one. This struck her mother with
consternation.</p>

<p>"Do you think your cold is so bad as that? I
would not wish you to do anything imprudent, but I
have often heard girls say that a ball was the very
best thing for a cold. If you were to nurse up this
evening, and have your breakfast in bed, I can't help
thinking you would feel quite yourself to-morrow,
my darling," Mrs. John said.</p>

<p>"It is not my cold," said Hester; and then she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
reflected that it was a pity to throw aside so excellent
a plea. "At least it is not altogether my
cold."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know how oppressed one feels, just good
for nothing; but, my love, you would feel sorry after.
It is a pity to give in. You shall have a foot-bath
to-night with some mustard in it, and a hot drink.
And you must not get up till mid-day. You'll feel
a great deal better after that."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go&mdash;I am tired of them," Hester
said, her impatience getting the better of her, "once
a week is a great deal too often. I am sick of the
very name of dancing."</p>

<p>"My love!" cried her mother in consternation.
Then she came behind her and gave her a soft little
kiss. "I think I shall give you quinine, for I am
sure you're low," she said, "and you must be bright
and well, and looking your best for Catherine's great
party, which is next week."</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;&mdash;" cried Hester, then stopped short,
for she had not the heart to give her mother a
double wound by declaring she would not go to
Catherine's party. One such blow was enough
at a time.</p>

<p>The astonishment with which her non-appearance
at Mrs. Merridew's was regarded by all the connection
was unbounded. The discovery that Hester <i>was
not going</i>, filled the Miss Ridgways with excitement.
What could be the cause?</p>

<p>"I suppose there has been a quarrel," the sisters
said. "Ellen is a little minx; but still she is a true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Vernon, and won't stand any such airs as that girl
gives herself. Her mother and she are insupportable,
with their pearls and their pretences."</p>

<p>"Roman pearls," said Mr. Mildmay Vernon, "and
Brummagem pretences."</p>

<p>So they discussed the question. When Hester
went in next day to Captain Morgan's, not without a
little curiosity to hear from Emma what had been
said of her absence: "I am glad you have recovered,"
Mrs. Morgan said, kissing her, and looking into her
face with an air of reproach and a shake of the head.</p>

<p>"It is not like you to give in for a cold," the old
captain added; but fortunately for Hester all explanation
on her part, and all remonstrance on theirs,
was cut short by the persevering deliberate voice
which now was the principal circumstance in the old
people's house.</p>

<p>"I assure you Ellen was very much astonished,
Hester. She looked at me as if she could not
believe her eyes. And they all looked at me as if it
was my fault. How could it be my fault? I didn't
give you your cold. I think there were more people
than usual. We had Sir Roger de Coverley, you
know, because it was Christmas. I danced it with
young Mr. Norris, who has just come into his fortune,
you know. He is very nice. He asked me for four
dances, but I only gave him three. Don't you think
I was right, grandmamma? That is the worst of
Ellen's parties, that there are no old chaperons with
experience, that could advise you on a point like
that. Two waltzes and then the Sir Roger, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
a sort of extra you know, and doesn't count. I
don't think there could be anything wrong in
that."</p>

<p>"You should not give in, Hester," said the old
captain. "That is not like you. What is a cold at
your age! You should always stand to your colours,
and hold your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I said to everybody, Hester had such a bad
cold," said Emma. "I said that her nose was red
and that it quite affected her voice. So it does.
You don't notice it so much when she flames up like
that. I wonder how you can blush in that way,
Hester. It is the difference of complexion, I suppose.
I always keep the same. It is nice in some
ways, for however hot it is you can be sure you are
not a figure; but in other respects I should like to
change colour like that. It makes you look interesting.
People think you are so sensitive, and that
sort of thing, when it's only just complexion. Harry
Vernon was more grumphy than ever because you
were not there, always standing about beside Ellen
and looking after her, which, considering she's
married, is a great deal more than any brother ought
to take upon him. I am sure if Roland did, I should
not know what to think. But then Ellen is an only
sister, which makes a great difference, and I am the
youngest. Reginald Merridew was in such a way!
I was engaged for almost every dance before he
came. I quite enjoyed it. I filled up my card as
soon as I could, just to give him a lesson. Men
should be kept in their proper places. I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
thought you showed half a spirit letting Edward
Vernon carry you off just as he pleased."</p>

<p>"My dear," said old Mrs. Morgan, making an
endeavour to strike in, we have not seen half so
much of you lately as we like to do. My old man
misses you on his walk. Do go and take a walk
with him, as your cold is better."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't send her away when I just want to
talk over everything," said Emma. "You never
think what young people like. I am sure you are
very kind and nice, grandmamma, I always say so.
Whatever any one may think, I always maintain
that you have been very nice and kind to me: and
kept me such a time&mdash;when I dare say you are tired
of me. But you don't remember what young people
like. Of course Hester wants to hear who was there,
and how every one was looking, and who danced
with who, and all that. There are always a hundred
things that we have to say to each other. Come up
with me to my room, Hester, and then we sha'n't
bore grandmamma and grandpapa. I have such a
lot to tell you. Ellen had such a lovely new dress,
old gold and black. It sounds much too old for her,
but it wasn't a bit. It was quite a change among all
the whites and pinks. I just went in my grenadine.
I don't pretend to cope with the rich girls, you know.
If the men want to dance with rich dresses they
must just leave me alone. I am always straightforward.
I say, 'Don't ask me unless you are sure you
don't mind.' But I suppose they like my dancing
or something, for I always have my card full. Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Roger de Coverley was really fun. We were all
dancing, it seemed about a mile going down the
middle. It is such a pity you weren't there. Edward
Vernon danced it with&mdash;I really forget who he
danced it with&mdash;one of the Miss Bradleys or Mary
Wargrave, or one of that set. Are you really going
out with grandpapa? That is awfully self-denying of
you, to please the old gentleman. And it is so cold.
Grandmamma, I do think you shouldn't let her go."</p>

<p>"She can hear your report another time&mdash;indeed
she has heard a great deal of it already," said old
Mrs. Morgan. "You don't lose any time, Emma.
But, Hester, if you are afraid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn't go on any account," cried Emma,
"with a bad cold. But then I have such dreadful
colds when I do have them. I am obliged to go to
bed. I never get my nose red like Hester's, nor lose
my voice&mdash;but I get such a cough. I am so thankful
I have not had one here. It gives everybody so
much trouble when you get ill on a visit, and you lose
all the good of the visit, and might just as well be at
home. There is grandpapa calling. I should just
let him call if it was me. Well, Hester, if you will
go, I can't help it. Come in again if you are not
afraid of the evening air, and you shall hear all the
rest; or if you'll have me at tea time, perhaps that
will be best. I'll go to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The old captain sighed as he went out. Emma
was, as it were, left speaking, standing on the step
of the door addressing Hester, as she followed her old
friend out into the dusky afternoon of one of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
black days that conclude the year. Very black days
they were on this occasion, not so cold as December
often is, without snow or any of the harsher signs of
winter, but also without sun or any of the exhilarating
sharpness of the frost. Everything was dry, but
dark, the skies leaden, the very Common showing
less green. The captain went on before with a woollen
comforter wrapped in many folds about his throat,
and woollen mittens on the hands which grasped his
stick with so much energy. He struck it against
the ground as if he had been striking some one as he
hurried away.</p>

<p>"I think that girl will be the death of us," he
said: then repented of his sharp utterance. "I told
you I thought you were a spiritual grandchild,
Hester. What the child of our child whom we lost,
who never had a child, would have been. And you
have spoiled us for the other thing&mdash;the grandchild
of common life."</p>

<p>"It is a long time since we have been out
together," said Hester, as the old man put his other
hand in its large mitten within her slender arm.</p>

<p>"And you have been in the meantime getting
into some of the muddles," he said. "It was kind of
my old wife to hand you over to me, Hester. We
all think our own experience the best. She would
like to have had you to herself, to find out all about
it, and give you the help of her old lights; but
instead of that she was self-denying, and handed you
over to me. And now let me hear what it is, and
see if the old ship's lantern will do you any good."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Am I in any muddles?" said Hester. "I don't
know&mdash;perhaps there is nothing to tell. It is so
hard to divide one thing from another."</p>

<p>"So it is; but when it is divided it is easier to
manage," said the old captain. He paused a little
to give her time to speak: but as she did not do so
he resumed on an indifferent subject, that the girl's
confidence might not be forced. "I am always glad
when the old year is over. You will say I am an old
fool for that, as my days are so few. But the first
of January is a great deal gayer than the first of
December, though they may be exactly like each
other. When you can say there will be spring this
year&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Captain Morgan," said Hester, who had been
taking advantage of the pause without paying any
attention to what he said, "Catherine Vernon is
angry because I wear my mother's pearls. How
should that be?"</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken, my dear," said the old
captain promptly. "She has her faults, but Catherine
is never paltry, Hester. That cannot be."</p>

<p>"Either you are very much mistaken about her,
or I am much mistaken about her," Hester said.</p>

<p>The old man looked at her with a smile on his
face.</p>

<p>"I don't say anything against that. And which
of us is most likely to be right?" he asked. "I knew
her before you were born."</p>

<p>"Oh, before I was born! Does that tell you anything
about her conduct to <i>me</i>? Once I was not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
but now I am; and somebody quite distinct from
other people."</p>

<p>"Very distinct!" Captain Morgan said.</p>

<p>"Then what does she mean by it?" cried Hester.
"She cannot endure the sight of me. Oh, I know
she is not paltry in one way. She does not care
about money, as some people do; but she is in
another. Why should she care about what I wear?
Did you ever hear anything about my father?" the
girl said, raising her eyes suddenly, and looking him
full in the face. The old captain was so taken by
surprise that he fell back a step and almost dropped
her arm in his dismay.</p>

<p>"About your father!"</p>

<p>"About him and Catherine Vernon&mdash;and how it
was he went away? He had as good a right to the
bank as she had, had he not? I have not thought
much about it; but I should like to know," said
Hester with more composure, "how it was that she
had it and not papa?"</p>

<p>"That was all before my time," said Captain
Morgan, who had recovered himself in the interval.
"I did not come here, you know, till after. And
then it is not as if I had been a Vernon to understand
all the circumstances. I was not of the family,
you know."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Hester thoughtfully, and she
suffered herself to be led into safer subjects without
any serious attempt to return to a question so unanswerable;
while Captain Morgan on his side was
too much alarmed by the possibility of having to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
explain to her the steps which had led to her father's
expatriation to inquire any more into the "muddles"
which he had read in her countenance. And
thus they made their way home together without
any mutual satisfaction. The captain was obliged to
own to his wife afterwards that he had given Hester
no aid or good advice.</p>

<p>"She asked me about her father: and was I going
to be so brutal as to tell the poor child what has
always been concealed from her?"</p>

<p>"Concealments are never good," Mrs. Morgan said,
shaking her head. "It would be better for her to
know." But the captain had an easy victory when
he said "Should you like to be the one to tell her?"
with defiance in his voice.</p>

<p>Thus the time went on for Catherine Vernon's
great Christmas party, to which all Redborough was
asked. It was not till the day before that Hester
was bold enough to declare her intention not to go.
"You must not be angry, mamma. What should I
go for? It is no pleasure. The moment I am in
Catherine Vernon's house I am all wrong. I feel
like a beggar, a poor relation, a dependent upon her
charity; and she has no charity for me. Don't make
me go."</p>

<p>"Oh Hester, my darling," said Mrs. John. "It
would never, never do to stay away, when everybody
is there! And you her relation, that ought to
wish to do her what honour you can."</p>

<p>"Why should I wish to do her honour? She has
never been kind to us. She has never treated you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
as she ought to have done. She has never behaved
to us as a relation should, or even as a gentlewoman
should."</p>

<p>"Oh hush! Hester, hush!" said Mrs. John. "You
don't know what you are speaking of. If you knew
all, you would know that Catherine has behaved to
us&mdash;better than we had any right to expect."</p>

<p>"Then let me know all, mother," said Hester,
sitting upright, her eyes shining, her whole face full
of inquiry. "I have felt lately that there must be
something which was concealed from me. Let me
know all."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. John faltered and explained. "There
is nothing for you to know. Dear, dear, you are so
literal. You take everything one says to you, Hester,
as if one meant it. There are just things that one
says&mdash;&mdash;When I said if you knew all, I meant&mdash;if
you were to consider properly, if you saw things in a
just light&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think you mean something more than that,"
Hester said.</p>

<p>"What should I mean more? We had no claims
upon her. Your poor father had got his share. He
had not perhaps been very prudent with it, but I
never understand anything about business. He got
his share, all that he had any right to expect.
Catherine might have said that, when we came back
so poor; but she did not. Hester, you have forgotten
what she has done for us. Oh, my dear, if
you knew all! No, I don't mean that there is anything
to know&mdash;but just if you would think&mdash;Hester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
you must not insult Catherine in the sight of all
Redborough by refusing to go to her party. You
must not, indeed you must not. If you do, you will
break my heart."</p>

<p>"What I do is of no importance to Catherine
Vernon. Oh, mother, do not make me go. It is
more than I can bear."</p>

<p>"But you are of importance, and she would feel
it deeply. Oh, Hester, for my sake!" Mrs. John
cried with tears in her eyes. She would not be
turned away from the subject or postpone it. Her
daughter had never seen her so deeply in earnest,
so intent upon having her way, before. On previous
occasions it had been Hester that had won the day.
But this time the girl had to give way to the impassioned
earnestness of her mother, which in so
mild a woman was strange to see.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<h3>THE PARTY AT THE GRANGE.</h3>


<p>Catherine's Christmas party called forth all Redborough.
It was an assembly to which the best
people in the place considered themselves bound to
go, notwithstanding that many of the small people
were there also. Everybody indeed was supposed to
come, and all classes were represented. The respectable
old clerks, who had spent their lives in the
bank, talked upon equal terms, according to the
fiction of society, with the magnates of the town,
and Edward and Harry Vernon, and others of the
golden youth, asked their daughters to dance. The
great ladies in their jewels sat about upon the sofas,
and so did Mrs. Halifax, the cashier's wife, and Mrs.
Brown, the head clerk's, in their ribbons. All was
supposed to be equality and happiness; if it were
not so, then the fault was upon the shoulders of the
guests, and not of the hostess, who walked about
from one to another, and was so civil to Mrs.
Brown&mdash;so very civil&mdash;that Lady Freemantle could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
not help whispering to Mrs. Merridew that, after all,
when a woman had once been engaged in business,
it always left a mark upon her.</p>

<p>"She is more at home with those sort of persons
than she is with the county," Lady Freemantle
said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merridew was deeply flattered with the confidence,
and gave a most cordial assent. "It does
give a sort of an unfeminine turn of mind, though
dear Miss Vernon is so universally respected," she
said.</p>

<p>This little dialogue would have given Catherine
sincere enjoyment if she had heard it. She divined
it from the conjunction of Lady Freemantle's
diamonds with Mrs. Merridew's lace, as they leant
towards each other, and from the expression and
direction of their eyes.</p>

<p>On her side Mrs. Brown drew conclusions quite as
fallacious. "Miss Vernon is well aware how much
the young gentlemen owe to Brown," that lady said
afterwards, "and how devoted he is. She knows
his value to the business, and I am sure she sees
that a share in the bank is what he has a right to
look to."</p>

<p>This delusion, however, Catherine did not divine.</p>

<p>It was with a reluctance and repugnance indescribable
that Hester had come: but she was
there, by the side of her mother, who, a little
alarmed by the crowd, did not know what to do
with herself, until Harry Vernon interposed and led
her to the corner of a sofa, in the very midst of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
fine people, which poor Mrs. John, divided between
the pride which was too proud to take a chief place
and the consciousness that this place was her right,
hesitated greatly upon.</p>

<p>"I think I should like to be farther off," she said,
faltering; "down there somewhere," and she pointed
in the direction of the Mrs. Browns&mdash;"or anywhere,"
she added, getting confused.</p>

<p>"This is your proper place," said Harry out of his
moustache, with persistence.</p>

<p>The poor lady sat down in a nervous flutter in her
black silk gown, which looked very nice, but had
lasted a long time, and though it had been kept, so
to speak, within sight of the fashion by frequent
alterations, was very different from the elegant
mixture of velvet and satin, fresh from the hands of
a court milliner, which swept over the greater part
of the space. Mrs. John had a little cap made of a
piece of fine Mechlin upon her hair, which was still
very pretty, and of the dark brown satin kind. Her
ornaments were of the most modest description,
whereas the other lady had a set of emeralds which
were the admiration of the county. Hester stood
behind her mother very erect and proud, in her
white muslin, with her pearls, looking like a maid of
honour to a mild, discrowned queen. A maid of
honour in such circumstances would stand a great
deal more upon her dignity than her mistress would
be likely to do. This was the aspect they presented
to the lookers-on who saw them in that unusual
eminence. When Catherine perceived where her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
poor pensioners were placed, she gave way to a
momentary impatience.</p>

<p>"Who put Mrs. John there?" she said to Edward,
almost with anger. "Don't you see how thoroughly
out of place she looks? You may think it shows a
fine regard for the fallen, but she would have been
much more comfortable at the other end among the
people she knows."</p>

<p>"I had nothing to do with it. I have not spoken
to them," said Edward with a certain sullenness.
He was glad to be able to exculpate himself, and yet
he despised himself all the more fiercely.</p>

<p>Catherine was vexed in a way which she herself
felt to be unworthy, but which she said to herself
was entirely justified by the awkwardness of the
situation.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is Harry that has done it," she said,
her voice softened by the discovery that Edward at
least was not to blame. "It must be said for him,
at least, that he is very faithful to his family."</p>

<p>Did she mean that <i>he</i> was not faithful? Edward
asked himself. Did even she despise him? But he
could not now change his course, or stoop to follow
Harry's example, that oaf who was inaccessible to
the fluctuations of sentiment around him, and could
do nothing but cling to his one idea. It cannot be
said, however, that either Mrs. John or Hester were
at their ease in their present position. It was true,
as Catherine had said, that with the curate's wife
Mrs. John would have been much more comfortable,
and this consciousness wounded the poor lady, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
felt now she was out of place among the people to
whom she was allied by nature. She was accustomed
to the slight of being put in a lower place,
but to feel herself so completely out of her old
position, went to her heart. She looked timidly,
poor soul, at the great lady with the emeralds,
remembering when she, too, used to be in the order
of great ladies, and wondering if in those days she
had ever despised the lowly. But when she thus
raised her eyes she found that the lady of the
emeralds was looking very fixedly at her.</p>

<p>"Surely," she said, after a little hesitation, "this
must be Lucy Westwood."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. John wistfully, investigating
the stranger with her timid eyes.</p>

<p>"Then have you forgotten 'Bridget&mdash;Fidget'?"
said the other.</p>

<p>It was a school name, and it brought a glow upon
Mrs. John's pale face. An old school-fellow! She
forgot all the painful past and her present embarrassment,
and even her daughter. Hester stood for
some time in her maid-of-honour attitude and contemplated
the conversation. She heard her mother
say, "This is my girl&mdash;the only one I have," and
felt herself crimsoning and curtseying vaguely to
some one she scarcely saw; then the stranger
added&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have three here; but I think they are all
dancing."</p>

<p>Yes, no doubt there was dancing going on, but
Hester had no part in it. She became tired, after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
while, of her post of maid of honour. Her wonderful
indignant carriage, the poise of her young head,
the proud air of independence which was evident in
her, called forth the admiration of many of the
spectators. "Who is that girl?" said the elder
people, who only came once a year, and were unacquainted
with the gossip of Redborough. "John
Vernon's daughter? Oh, that was the man who
ought to have married Catherine&mdash;he who nearly
ruined the bank. And that is her mother? How
good of Catherine to have them here." If Hester
had heard these remarks she would have had few
questions to ask about her father. But she was
unaware of the notice she was attracting, placed thus
at the head of the great drawing-room. The folding
doors had been removed and the two rooms made
into one. The girl was in the most conspicuous
position without knowing; her white figure stood
out against the wall, with her little mother in the
foreground. She stood for a long time looking out
with large eyes, full of light, upon the crowd, her
varying emotions very legible in her face. When a
creature so young and full of life feels herself
neglected and disdained, and sees others about her
whom her keen eyes cannot help but see are inferior
to herself, promoted far above her, enjoying what is
forbidden to her, finding pleasure where she has
none&mdash;yet is bound to the spot and cannot escape, it
is natural that indignation should light fires in her
eyes, and that her breast should swell and her young
countenance glow with a visionary scorn of all who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
seem to scorn her. This sentiment is neither amiable
nor desirable, but it gave a sort of inspiration to
Hester&mdash;her head so erect, slightly thrown back, her
nostrils a little dilated, her mouth shut close, her
eyes large and open, regarding in full face the world
of enemies against whom, wholly or singly, she felt
herself ready to stand. All this gave a character
and individuality to her such as nothing in the room
could equal. But by and by she tired of standing,
shut out from everybody, holding up her banner.
She stole away from her mother's side, behind the
chairs, to get to somebody she knew and could
talk to. Flesh and blood cannot bear this sort of
martyrdom of pride for ever.</p>

<p>An old man was standing in her way, who made a
little movement to stop Hester as she passed. "You
will excuse an old friend, Miss Hester," he said;
"but I must tell you how glad I am to see you and
your mother. I have been looking at you both ever
since you came. She is very much changed since
I used to see her, but her sweet expression is the
same. That is a thing that will never change."</p>

<p>"I think I know you," said Hester, with the shy
frankness which was so unlike her hostile attitude.
"Did not I see you at Captain Morgan's? and you
said something to me about my mother?"</p>

<p>"I had not much time to tell you then. I should
just like to describe it to you," said the old clerk.
"I have never forgotten that day. I was in a
dreadful state of anxiety, fearing that everything
was coming to an end; and the only place I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
think of going to was the White House. That
was where your parents were staying at the time.
No, no, they were not your parents then; I think
there was a little baby that died&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was born abroad," said Hester, eager to catch
every word.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, to be sure; and she was quite young,
not much older than you are now. It was in that
long room at the White House, with a window at
each end, which is the dining-room now. You will
excuse me for being a little long-winded, Miss Hester.
It was beautifully furnished, as we thought then;
and there was a harp and a piano. Does your
mamma ever play the harp now? No, no, I ought
to remember, that has quite gone out of fashion.
She had her hair high up on her head like this," said
Mr. Rule, trying to give a pantomimic description
on the top of his own grey head of the high bows
which had once adorned Mrs. John's. "She had a
white dress on, far shorter than you wear them now;
and little slippers with crossed bands, sandals they
used to call them. Oh, I remember everything like
a picture! Ladies used to wear little short sleeves
in those days, and low dresses. She had a little
scarf round her over one shoulder. What a pretty
creature she was, to be sure! I had been so wretched
and anxious that the sight of her as I came rushing
in, had the strangest effect upon me. All bank
business and our troubles about money, and the
terror of a run, which was what I was frightened
for, seemed nothing but ugly dreams, without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
reality in them. I dare say you don't know, Miss
Hester, what I mean by a run?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said Hester, a little impatient;
"but I should like to know what happened after."</p>

<p>"A run on the bank," said the old clerk, "is the
most terrible thing in all creation. A battle is
nothing to it&mdash;for in a battle you can at least fight
for your life. It happens when the partners or the
company, or whatever they may be, have had losses,
or are reported to have had losses, and a rumour
gets up against the bank. Sometimes it may be a
long time threatening, sometimes it may get up in a
single day&mdash;but as soon as the rumour gets the length
of a panic, everybody that has money deposited
comes to draw it out, and everybody that has a note
of the bank comes for his money. In those days
Vernon's issued notes, like all the other great country
banks. I was in mortal terror for a run: I never
was in such a state in my life. And it was then, as
I told you, Miss Hester, that I went to your mother.
Of course we had not money enough to meet it&mdash;the
most solvent could scarcely hope to have that at
a moment's notice. Next day was the market day,
and I knew that, as sure as life&mdash;&mdash;! I have passed
through many a troublesome moment, but never one
like that."</p>

<p>And, as if even the thinking of it was more than
he could bear, the old clerk took out his handkerchief
and wiped his forehead. Hester had listened
with great interest, but still with a little impatience:
for though the run upon the bank would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
interested her at another time, it was more than
her attention was equal to now.</p>

<p>"But was not my father here as well as my
mother?" said Hester, in her clear voice, unconscious
of any need to subdue it.</p>

<p>Mr. Rule looked at her with a startled air and a
half-involuntary "Hush!"</p>

<p>"Your father!" he said, with a tone of consternation.
"Oh; the fact was that your father&mdash;did
not happen to be there at the time."</p>

<p>Hester waved her hand slightly as a token for him
to go on. She had a feeling that these words were
of more importance than they seemed to be, but they
confused her, and she did not as yet see what this
importance was. She remembered that she had
thought so when he told her this incident before.</p>

<p>"Where was I?" said Mr. Rule. "Oh, yes, I
remember; just going into the White House with
my mind full of trouble, not knowing what to do.
Well, Miss Hester, when I found that your&mdash;I mean
when I discovered that your&mdash;mother was alone, I
told her the dreadful condition I was in&mdash;Nobody to
say what to do, no chief authority to direct, and
market-day to-morrow, and a run as sure as fate.
Now, you know, we could have telegraphed all over
the country, but there was no such thing as a
telegraph then. I had to explain it to her just as
I have to you, and I feel sure she didn't understand
me in the very least. She only knew there was
money wanted. She stepped across the room in her
pretty sandals, with her scarf hanging from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
shoulders, as if she had been going to play her harp,
and opened a little bit of a desk, one of those
gimcrack things, all rosewood and velvet, which
were the fashion then, and took out all her money
and brought it to me. It was in our own notes,
poor dear," said old Rule, with a little laugh; "and
it came to just twenty pounds. She would have
made me take it&mdash;forced it upon me. She did not
understand a bit. She was full of trouble and
sympathy, and ready to give up everything. Ah,
I have often told Miss Vernon since. It was not
want of will; it was only that she did not
understand."</p>

<p>"I am sure you mean to speak kindly of mamma,"
said Hester, with a quick blush of alarmed pride;
"but I don't think it is so difficult to make her
understand. And what did you do after that? Was
there a run&mdash;and how did you provide&mdash;?"</p>

<p>She did not know what to say, the questions
seemed to get into her throat and choke her. There
was something else which she could not understand
which must soon be made clear. She gave furtive
glances at the old clerk, but did not look him in
the face.</p>

<p>"Ah, I went to Miss Vernon. She was but a
young lady then. Oh, I don't mean to say young
like you. It is thirty years ago. She was older
than your pretty young mamma, and though she
had a great share in the business she never had
taken any part in it. But she was come of a family
that have all had fine heads for business. Look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Mr. Edward now: what a clear understanding he
has, and sees exactly the right thing to do, whatever
happens. She was a little shocked and startled just
at first, but she took it up in a moment, no man
could have done it better. She signed away all her
money in the twinkling of an eye, and saved the
bank. When all the crowd of the country folk came
rushing to draw out their money, she stepped in&mdash;well,
like a kind of goddess to us, Miss Hester&mdash;and
paid in almost her whole fortune, all her mother's
money, every penny she had out of the business,
and pulled us through. I can remember her too, as
if it had been yesterday, the way she stepped in&mdash;with
her head held high, and a kind of a triumph
about her; something like what I have seen in
yourself, my dear young lady."</p>

<p>"Seen in me! You have never seen me with any
triumph about me," cried Hester, bitterly. "And
where have you seen me? I scarcely know you.
Ah, that was because of the money she had. My
mother, with her twenty pounds, what could she
do? But Catherine was rich. It was because of
her money."</p>

<p>"Her money was a great deal: but it was not
the money alone. It was the heart and the courage
she had. We had nobody to tell us what to do&mdash;but
after she came, all went well. She had such a
head for business."</p>

<p>Hester could not stand and listen to Catherine's
praises; but she was entirely absorbed in the narrative.
It seemed terrible to her that she had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
been there to be able to step in as Catherine had
done. But there was another question pressing
upon her which she had asked already, and to which
she had got no reply. She shrank from repeating it
yet felt a force upon her to do so. She fixed her
large widely-opened eyes upon the speaker, so as
to lose none of the indications of his face.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me," she said, "how it was that
you had, as you say, nobody to tell you anything&mdash;no
one at the head&mdash;nobody to say what was to
be done?"</p>

<p>Old Mr. Rule did not immediately reply. He
made a little pause, and shuffled with his feet,
looking down at them, not meeting her eyes.</p>

<p>"Hester," said Ellen Merridew, who was passing,
and paused on her partner's arm to interfere, "why
don't you dance? What do you mean by not
dancing? What are you doing here behind backs?
I have been looking for you everywhere."</p>

<p>"I prefer to be here," Hester answered, shortly;
"never mind me, please. Mr. Rule, will you answer
me? I want to know."</p>

<p>"You asked how it was that we&mdash;&mdash; What was
it you asked, Miss Hester? I am very glad to see
you so interested: but you ought to be dancing,
not talking to an old man, as Mrs. Merridew
says."</p>

<p>"I think you are all in a plot against me," said
Hester, impatiently; "why was it you were left
without a head? What had happened? Mr. Rule,"
cried the girl, "you know what I asked, and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
know why I am so anxious. You are trying to put
me off. What does it all mean?"</p>

<p>"It is an old story," he said; "I cannot tell what
tempted me to begin about it. It was seeing you
and your mother for the first time. You were not
at Miss Vernon's party last year?"</p>

<p>"What has that to do with it?" cried Hester.
"If you will not tell me, say so. I shall find out
some other way."</p>

<p>"My dear young lady, ask me anything. Don't
find out any other way. I will come and see you, if
your mamma will permit me, and tell you everything
about the old days. But I can't keep you
longer now. And, besides, it would need a great
deal of explanation. I was foolish to begin about it
here, keeping you out of your natural amusement.
But I'll come and tell you, Miss Hester, with
pleasure," said the old man, putting on a show of
easy cordiality, "any day you will name."</p>

<p>"Hester," said another voice over her head,
"Ellen says I am not to let you stay here. Come
and see the supper-room. And the hall is very
pretty. I am not to go without you, Ellen says."</p>

<p>"Oh, what do I care for Ellen!" cried Hester,
exasperated. "Go away, Harry; go and dance and
amuse yourself. I don't want you or any one.
Mr. Rule&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the old clerk had seized his opportunity. He
had made a dart at some one else on the other side
while Hester turned to reply to Harry's demand.
The girl found herself abandoned when she turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
to him again. There had been a gradual shifting in
the groups about while she stood absorbed listening
to his story. She was standing now among people
who were strange to her, and who looked at her
curiously, knowing her to be "one of the family."
As she met their curious eyes, Hester, though she
had a high courage, felt her heart fail her. She
was glad to fall back upon her cousin's support.</p>

<p>"I think you are all in a conspiracy against me,"
she said; but she took Harry's arm. He never
abandoned her in any circumstances. Edward had
not spoken to her, nor noticed her presence; but
Harry never failed. In her excitement and disappointment
she turned to him with a sense that here
she could not go wrong. As for Harry, to whom she
was seldom so complacent, he drew her arm within
his own with a flush of pleasure.</p>

<p>"I know you don't think much of me," he said,
"but surely I am as good as that old fellow!" a
speech at which Hester could not but laugh. "I
should like to know what he was saying to you,"
Harry said.</p>

<p>"He was telling me about the run on the bank
and how Catherine saved it. Do you know&mdash;I
wonder&mdash;&mdash; Had my father never anything to do
with it?" Hester said.</p>

<p>They were making their way through the crowd
at the end of the room. And Harry's countenance
was not expressive. Hester thought the stare in his
eyes was directed to somebody behind who had
pushed against her. She was not suspicious that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Harry could hide from her any knowledge he
possessed.</p>

<p>"That was ages before my time," he said very
steadily. "You might as well ask me about the
flood;" and so led her on through the many groups
about the door, entirely unsuspicious that he, too,
for whom she had an affectionate contempt, had
baulked her. She allowed him to take her over all
the lighted rooms which opened into each other:
the hall, the library, the room blazing with lights
and decorations, which was prepared for supper.
Hester had never been before at one of these great
assemblies. And she could not keep herself entirely
unmoved by the dazzling of the lights, the warmth
and largeness of the entertainment. A sort of pride
came upon her, surprising her in spite of herself:
though she was so humble a member of the family,
and subject under this roof to slights and scorns,
yet she was a Vernon, and could not escape some
reflection of the family glory which centred in
Catherine. And as she went into the hall a still
more strange sensation suddenly came over Hester.
She caught sight, in a large mirror, of herself
stepping forward, her head held high in its habitual
poise of half indignant energy, and a certain swiftness
in her air and movement, a sentiment of forward
motion and progress, very familiar to everybody who
knew her, but which brought suddenly to her mind
old Rule's description, "stepping in with a kind
of triumph about her, as I have seen yourself."
"Triumph!" Hester said secretly within herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
and coloured high, with a sensation of mingled
pain and pleasure, which no words could have described.
She did not know what it meant; but it
stirred her strangely. If she had been in these
circumstances she would have acted like Catherine.
The story of her mother in her gentle ignorance,
which the old clerk thought so much of, did not
affect the high-spirited girl as did the picture of the
other putting herself in the breach, taking upon her
own shoulders the weight of the falling house.
Hester felt that she, too, could have done this.
Her breast swelled, her breath came short with an
impulse of impatience and longing to have such an
opportunity, to show the mettle that was in her.
But how could she do it? Catherine was rich, but
Hester was poor. In this way she was diverted for
the moment from her anxiety. The question as to
how the bank came into that peril, the suspicion
that her father must have been somehow connected
with it, the heat of her research after the key of the
mystery, faded away for the moment in a vague,
general excitement and eager yet vain desire to have
it in her power to do something, she also&mdash;&mdash;a
desire which many a young mind has felt as well
as Hester; to have that golden opportunity&mdash;the
occasion to do a heroic deed, to save some one, to
venture your own life, to escape the bonds of every
day, and once have a chance of showing what was in
you! This was not the "chance" which Emma
Ashton desired, but it appealed to every sentiment
in Hester. The strong longing for it seemed almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
to promise a possibility, as she walked along in a
dream, without noticing Harry by her side. And
he did not disturb her by conversation. It was
enough for Harry to feel her hand on his arm.
He had never very much to say, and he did not
insist upon saying it. He was content to lead her
about, to show her everything; and the sensation
of taking care of her was pleasant to his heart.</p>

<p>When they reached the hall, however, they became
aware of a late arrival, which had a certain effect
upon both. Standing near the great door, which
had been opened a minute before to admit him,
sending a thrill of cold night air through the whole
warm succession of rooms, stood Roland Ashton.
Hester was aware that he was expected, but not
that he was coming here. A servant was helping
him off with his coat, and Edward stood beside him
in eager conversation. Edward's countenance, generally
toned down to the air of decorum and self-command
which he thought necessary, was excited
and glowing. And Harry, too, lighted up when he
saw the new comer. "Ah, there's Ashton!" he
said; while from one of the other doors Catherine
Vernon herself, with a white shawl over her shoulders,
came out from amidst her other guests to
welcome her kinsman. It was a wonderful reception
for a young man who was not distinguished
either by rank or wealth. Hester had to hang
back, keeping persistently in the shade, to prevent
her companion from hurrying forward into the
circle of welcoming faces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"I felt the cold air from the door at the very end
of the drawing-room," Catherine said; "but though
it made me shiver it was not unwelcome, Roland.
I knew that it meant that you had come."</p>

<p>"I wish my coming had not cost you a shiver,"
Roland cried.</p>

<p>"One moment; I must say how d'ye do to him,"
said Harry in Hester's ear; and even he, the faithfulest
one, left her for a moment to hold out his
hand to the new comer.</p>

<p>The girl stood apart, sheltering herself under the
shade of the plants with which the hall was filled,
and looked on at this scene. There was in the
whole group a curious connection with herself.
Even to Catherine she, perhaps, poor girl as she
was, was the guest among all the others who roused
the keenest feeling. Edward, who did not venture
to look at her here, had given her every reason to
believe that his mind was full of her. Harry had put
his life at her disposal. Roland&mdash;Roland had taken
possession of her mind and thoughts for a few weeks
with a completeness of influence which probably he
never intended, which, perhaps, was nothing at all
to him, which it made Hester blush to remember.
They all stood together, their faces lighted up with
interest while she looked on. Hester stood under
a great myrtle bush, which shaded her face, and
looked at them in the thrill of the excitement which
the previous events of the evening had called forth.
A sort of prophetic sense that the lives of all were
linked with her own, a presentiment that between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
them and among them it would be hers to work
either for weal or woe, came over her like a sudden
revelation. It was altogether fanciful and absurd
she felt; but the impression was so strong that she
turned and fled, with a sudden impulse to avoid the
fate that seemed almost to overshadow her as she
stood and looked at them. She, who a moment
before had been longing for the heroic opportunity,
the power of interposing as Catherine had interposed,
felt all the panic of a child come over her as she
stood and gazed at the four people, not one of whom
was indifferent to her. She hurried out of the comparative
quiet of the hall into the crowd, and made
her way with a trembling of nervous excitement to
where her mother sat. Mrs. John was still seated
serenely on her sofa talking of old school-days and
comrades with the lady of the emeralds. She was
serene, yet there was a little gentle excitement
about her too, a little additional colour upon her
soft cheek. Hester, with her heart beating loudly
and a strange tumult in her veins, took refuge
behind her mother with a sense of protection which
she had never felt before. The soft nature which
was ready to be touched by any gentle emotion,
which understood none of life's problems, yet, by
patience and simplicity, sailed over them all, is often
a shield to those that see more and feel more.
Behind her unconscious mother Hester seemed to
herself to take refuge from her fate.</p>

<p>It was a great elevation to Mrs. John to sit there
at the upper part of the room, among the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
ladies, out of the crowd of less distinguished persons.
Her feeling of embarrassed shyness and sense of
being out of place had all vanished when she discovered
her old friend; and from that time she had
begun to enjoy herself with a soothing consciousness
that all proper respect was paid to her, and that at
last, without any doing of hers, all, as she said to
herself, had come right. She assented with gentle
cordiality to all that was said to her about the
beauty of the house, and the perfection of the
arrangements.</p>

<p>"Catherine is wonderful," she said; "she has
such a head; she understands everything," and not
a feeling in her heart contradicted her words.</p>

<p>That evening was, in its way, a gentle triumph to
the gentle little woman. Hester had disappeared
from her for a time, and had been, she had no doubt,
enjoying herself; and then she had come back and
stood dutifully by her mother, such a maid of honour
as any queen might have been proud of. She had
a thousand things to say of the assembly; of dear
Bridget Wilton, who recollected her so well, and
who was now quite a great person; of the prettiness
of the party, and the girls' dresses, and all the light
and brilliancy of the scene&mdash;when at last it was all
over and they had reached home.</p>

<p>"Now I am sure you are glad you went," she
said, with innocent confidence. "It is a long, long
time since I have spent so pleasant an evening.
You see Catherine would not allow me to be overlooked
when it was really a great party. She knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
very well what is due. She did not mind at those
little evenings, which are of no importance; but
to-night you could see how different it was. Bridget
insisted that Sir John himself should take me to
supper. No, dear, it was nothing more than was
right, but it shows, what I always thought, that no
neglect was ever intended. And Catherine was
very kind. I am sure now you are glad you
went."</p>

<p>Was she glad she had gone? Hester could not
tell. She closed the door between her and her
mother as if she were afraid that Mrs. John in
her unusual exhilaration might read her thoughts.
These thoughts were almost too great to be confined
within her own spirit. As she lay down in
the dark she seemed to see the light shining all
about her, the groups in the ball-room&mdash;the old
man garrulous, deep in the revelations of the past,
and the cluster of figures all standing together under
the light of the lamps, exchanging questions which
meant, though she could scarcely tell how, the
future to Hester. Perhaps, on the whole, it was
true, and she was glad she had gone.</p>
